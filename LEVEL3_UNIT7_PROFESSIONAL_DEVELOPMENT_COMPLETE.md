## ü™û REFLECTIVE PRACTICE

### What is Reflection?

Thinking deeply about your experiences to learn and improve.

### Gibbs' Reflective Cycle:

**1. Description**
- What happened?
- Who was involved?
- Where and when?

**2. Feelings**
- How did you feel?
- What were you thinking?
- What emotions did you experience?

**3. Evaluation**
- What was good?
- What was bad?
- What went well?
- What didn't go well?

**4. Analysis**
- Why did it happen?
- What sense can you make of it?
- What does it mean?

**5. Conclusion**
- What else could you have done?
- What did you learn?
- What would you do differently?

**6. Action Plan**
- What will you do next time?
- What do you need to learn?
- How will you improve?

---

### Example Reflection:

**Description:**  
I was helping Mrs. Ahmed with personal care. She became upset and refused help.

**Feelings:**  
I felt frustrated and unsure what to do. I was worried I'd done something wrong.

**Evaluation:**  
Good: I stayed calm and didn't force her.  
Bad: I didn't understand why she was upset.

**Analysis:**  
I realized I hadn't explained what I was going to do. Mrs. Ahmed has dementia and needs clear communication.

**Conclusion:**  
I should always explain each step, even if I've done it before. Communication is key with dementia.

**Action Plan:**  
I will attend dementia training and practice explaining each step of care clearly.
