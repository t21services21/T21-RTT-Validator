## 🚨 Current Problem

**Too many modules = Too many potential issues**

Right now you have:
- 7 core modules (tested)
- 22 new clinical modules (untested)
- 6 training modules (tested)
- 3 admin modules (tested)

**Total: 38 modules in sidebar!**

This is overwhelming and makes it hard to:
- Find what you need
- Test systematically
- Identify bugs
- Maintain quality

---

## ✅ Recommended Solution

**Start with 13 core modules:**
- 7 automation modules
- 6 training modules

**Hide the rest until tested:**
- 22 new clinical modules
- 10 advanced features

**Result:**
- Clean, focused sidebar
- Easy to test
- Professional appearance
- Gradual expansion

## 🎯 Next Steps

Would you like me to:

1. **Option A:** Create a simplified sidebar with only core 13 modules?
2. **Option B:** Add collapsible sections to organize modules better?
3. **Option C:** Keep all modules but add a "Beta" tag to untested ones?

**Recommendation: Option A** - Clean slate, test core first, add more later.
