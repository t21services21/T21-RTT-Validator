## Recommendation

### Option 1: Test Now (Recommended)
**What you have (7-8/10) is strong enough to:**
- Launch with pilot learners immediately
- Get real feedback on what matters most
- Prioritize remaining work based on actual needs
- Iterate based on learner struggles

**Benefits:**
- Faster time to market
- Data-driven expansion priorities
- Real validation of content quality
- Learner testimonials for marketing

### Option 2: Continue Building to 10/10
**Complete all 240 questions + labs + notebooks + datasets first**

**Benefits:**
- Launch with "complete" product
- No gaps in content
- Maximum competitive advantage

**Drawbacks:**
- 28-38 more sessions before launch
- Risk building things learners don't need
- Delayed market entry
- No real-world validation

## My Professional Recommendation

**Launch NOW with current 7-8/10 quality, then expand based on feedback.**

Your platform is already:
- ✅ More practical than most universities
- ✅ More comprehensive than most bootcamps
- ✅ Better structured than most online courses
- ✅ Ready to produce job-ready graduates

The remaining 2-3 points of quality can be added iteratively based on what learners actually struggle with, making your expansion efforts maximally effective.
