## **💡 WHY THIS MATTERS:**

### **RTT Code Visibility:**
- ✅ Validators can see which code was used
- ✅ Can verify correct code applied
- ✅ Audit trail visible
- ✅ Pathway status makes sense

### **Edit Functionality:**
- ✅ Fix human errors quickly
- ✅ Don't need to delete and recreate
- ✅ Maintain episode ID and links
- ✅ Correct data = correct pathways
- ✅ Prevent validation errors

**This closes a critical gap!** Without edit functionality, any mistake meant deleting and recreating the episode, losing links and history!

---

## **🚀 READY FOR DEPLOYMENT:**

All files modified and tested:
- ✅ pathway_management_ui.py (RTT code display + Edit buttons)
- ✅ episode_management_ui.py (Pre-selection + Full edit form)

Part of comprehensive deployment:
```
DEPLOY_ALL_FIXES_COMPREHENSIVE.bat
```

**Episodes now show RTT codes AND can be edited to fix mistakes!** ✅

**No more recreating episodes when errors happen!** 🎉
