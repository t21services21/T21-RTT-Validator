## 📚 Part 3: Detailed Answers (Top 50 Questions)

### SQL Answers

**Q1: Difference between WHERE and HAVING?**

**Answer:** 
- `WHERE` filters rows BEFORE grouping
- `HAVING` filters groups AFTER aggregation
- Example: "Show departments with average salary > £50k"
  ```sql
  SELECT department, AVG(salary) as avg_sal
  FROM employees
  WHERE active = 1  -- Filter individual rows first
  GROUP BY department
  HAVING AVG(salary) > 50000;  -- Filter aggregated results
  ```

**Q2: Top 5 customers by total spend**

**Answer:**
```sql
SELECT customer_id, 
       customer_name,
       SUM(order_amount) as total_spend
FROM orders o
JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.id
GROUP BY customer_id, customer_name
ORDER BY total_spend DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

**Q3: INNER JOIN vs LEFT JOIN**

**Answer:**
- `INNER JOIN`: Returns only matching rows from both tables
- `LEFT JOIN`: Returns all rows from left table + matching rows from right (NULL if no match)

Example:
```sql
-- INNER JOIN: Only customers who placed orders
SELECT c.name, o.order_id
FROM customers c
INNER JOIN orders o ON c.id = o.customer_id;

-- LEFT JOIN: All customers, including those with no orders
SELECT c.name, o.order_id
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN orders o ON c.id = o.customer_id;
```
