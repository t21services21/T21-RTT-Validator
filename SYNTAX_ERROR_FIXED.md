# 🐛 SYNTAX ERROR - FIXED!

**Date:** 2025-10-10 17:14  
**Error:** SyntaxError on Streamlit Cloud deployment

---

## Problem

After deleting `pages/2fa_setup.py`, the app crashed with:
```
SyntaxError: This app has encountered an error
```

## Root Cause

`sidebar_manager.py` line 135 was trying to link to the deleted file:
```python
st.switch_page("pages/2fa_setup.py")  # ❌ File deleted!
```

## The Fix

Changed line 135 to point to the correct file:
```python
st.switch_page("pages/security_2fa.py")  # ✅ Correct file
```

## Verification

✅ All files compile successfully  
✅ No more references to deleted file  
✅ Sidebar 2FA button now works correctly

**Status:** FIXED ✅  
**File Modified:** `sidebar_manager.py`  
**Ready to deploy:** YES
