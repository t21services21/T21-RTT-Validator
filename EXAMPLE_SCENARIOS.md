## Timeline Auditor Examples

### Example 1: Correct Timeline ‚úÖ

```
01/02/2025 ‚Äì Referral received ‚Äì Code 10 ‚Äì GP to ENT
10/02/2025 ‚Äì New OP ‚Äì Code 20
22/02/2025 ‚Äì Diagnostics ‚Äì Code 92
01/03/2025 ‚Äì DTT ‚Äì Code 20
20/03/2025 ‚Äì Septoplasty ‚Äì Code 30
```

**Expected Result:** Pass (correct sequencing)

---

### Example 2: Duplicate Code 10 ‚ùå

```
01/02/2025 ‚Äì Referral received ‚Äì Code 10
06/02/2025 ‚Äì New OP ‚Äì Code 10
18/02/2025 ‚Äì Diagnostics ‚Äì Code 20
```

---

### Example 3: Code 91 Without AM Start ‚ùå

```
01/02/2025 ‚Äì Referral received ‚Äì Code 10
10/02/2025 ‚Äì OP review ‚Äì Code 91

### Example 4: Code 20 After Treatment ‚ùå

```
01/02/2025 ‚Äì Referral received ‚Äì Code 10
10/02/2025 ‚Äì New OP ‚Äì Code 20
20/02/2025 ‚Äì Surgery (FDT) ‚Äì Code 30
05/03/2025 ‚Äì Post-op review ‚Äì Code 20
```

**Expected Result:** Warning  
**Issue:** Code 20 used after code 30 (treatment)  
**Fix:** Change 05/03/2025 to code 90 (FDT occurred previously)

## Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: Identify the Breach
**Given:**
- Referral: 01/09/2024
- First Appt: 15/09/2024
- Treatment: 15/02/2025
- Patient delay: 2 weeks

**Question:** What is the breach status?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

Total weeks: 24  
Adjusted: 24 - 2 = 22 weeks  
**Breach Flag:** 18-week breach (over 18 but under 26)

</details>

---

### Exercise 2: Choose the Correct Code
**Scenario:** Patient attends 3rd review during active monitoring period.

**Question:** What code should be used?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Code 91** (Activity during active monitoring)  
Note: This assumes code 31 or 32 was recorded when AM started.

</details>

---

### Exercise 3: Spot the Timeline Error
**Timeline:**
```
01/01/2025 ‚Äì Referral ‚Äì Code 10
15/01/2025 ‚Äì OP ‚Äì Code 20
20/01/2025 ‚Äì Surgery ‚Äì Code 30
25/01/2025 ‚Äì Surgery ‚Äì Code 30
```

**Question:** What's wrong?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Duplicate code 30** - Code 30 should only appear ONCE per pathway.  
Second surgery (if genuine) should be recorded as part of the same treatment episode or a new pathway must be started.

</details>

## Tips for Using the App

1. **Start with simple scenarios** (Example 1) to understand the flow
2. **Experiment with dates** to see breach thresholds in action
3. **Test pause logic** by adding patient-initiated delays
4. **Use the Timeline Auditor** to understand code sequencing rules
5. **Read the "About RTT Rules"** section for quick reference
