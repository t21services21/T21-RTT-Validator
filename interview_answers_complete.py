It's important because:
1. **Patient care** - ensures timely treatment and better outcomes
2. **Trust performance** - monitored nationally
3. **Legal compliance** - constitutional right under NHS Constitution

The pathway starts when GP referral is received (Code 10) or consultant decides to treat (Code 20), and stops when patient receives first treatment (Code 30) or declines treatment (Code 31/32).

Accurate tracking prevents breaches and ensures patients aren't delayed.""",
