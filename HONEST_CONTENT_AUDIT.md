---

## ⚠️ WHAT WAS DOCUMENTED BUT NOT FULLY IMPLEMENTED

### 1. Detailed Lab Instructions
**Documented:** 105 labs with step-by-step instructions
**Reality:** Lab DESCRIPTIONS exist in code, but detailed step-by-step guides are in MARKDOWN files, not integrated into the platform interface

**What Exists:**
- Brief lab descriptions in practicals arrays
- Suggested lab structure
- DETAILED_LABS_EXPANSION.md has 2 fully detailed examples

**What's Missing:**
- 103 labs need the detailed treatment shown in expansion doc
- Step-by-step instructions not visible in Streamlit UI
- Troubleshooting guides not integrated

**Impact on Job-Readiness:** MEDIUM - Learners can still complete labs, but may struggle more
**Action Needed:** Integrate detailed lab guides into platform OR provide as downloadable PDFs

---

### 2. Filled Notebooks
**Documented:** 21 notebooks filled with complete examples
**Reality:** Need to check if notebooks are scaffolds or fully worked

**What Exists:**
- 21 .ipynb files exist
- Notebook structures defined

**What Needs Verification:**
- Are cells filled with code or empty?
- Are outputs included?
- Are explanations complete?

**Impact on Job-Readiness:** HIGH if empty - Learners need worked examples
**Action Needed:** Verify notebook contents, fill if needed

---

### 3. 50 Datasets
**Documented:** 50 realistic datasets across 5 domains
**Reality:** Only 10 CSV files exist

**What Exists:**
- 10 functional datasets
- Cover core scenarios

**What's Missing:**
- 40 additional datasets
- Data dictionaries for most
- Domain variety as documented

**Impact on Job-Readiness:** LOW - 10 datasets are sufficient for learning
**Action Needed:** Add more datasets for variety (NOT critical for launch)

---
