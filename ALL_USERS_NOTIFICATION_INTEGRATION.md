    # ADD THIS LINE:
    notify_student_assignment_graded(student_email, assignment_name, grade, feedback)

    for patient in patients:
        days_remaining = calculate_days_to_breach(patient)
        
        if days_remaining < 28:
            # ADD THIS LINE:
            notify_nhs_rtt_breach_alert(
