## 📈 EXPANSION APPROACH

### Phase 1: Data Science Foundations (THIS SESSION)
**Estimated Time:** 6-8 hours  
**Priority:** IMMEDIATE

**Expansion Target Per Unit:**
- Theory: 20 lines → 500+ lines (25x expansion)
- Include:
  - Real-world context
  - Code examples (Python/Pandas/SQL)
  - Visual diagrams (ASCII art)
  - Step-by-step tutorials
  - Common mistakes
  - Best practices
  - Career relevance

**Labs:**
- Transform brief prompts → comprehensive instructions
- 10-20 step exercises
- Sample data/code provided
- Assessment rubrics

---

### Phase 2: Data Engineer Pathway (NEXT)
**Estimated Time:** 6-8 hours  
**Rationale:** High commercial value, different from DS content (less overlap)

---

### Phase 3: ML Pathways (DS2 & DS3)
**Estimated Time:** 12-16 hours  
**Rationale:** More specialized, can be expanded based on demand
