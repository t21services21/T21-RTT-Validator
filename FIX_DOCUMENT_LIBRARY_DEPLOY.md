# 🔧 DOCUMENT LIBRARY FIX - DEPLOY NOW!

**Date:** October 24, 2025 9:27 AM  
**Issue:** Document library not showing for admin users  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED - Ready to deploy

---

## 🐛 **PROBLEM FOUND:**

The document library had **restrictive role checking** that didn't include:
- ❌ `super_admin` role
- ❌ `tester` role  
- ❌ `teacher`/`instructor`/`trainer` roles
- ❌ Email-based super admin check

**Result:** Even though it was in the menu, clicking it showed "not available" message.

---

## ✅ **WHAT WAS FIXED:**

### **Before:**
```python
if user_role not in ['admin', 'tutor', 'assessor', 'staff']:
    st.warning("⚠️ Document library is only available...")
    return
```

### **After:**
```python
# Check if super admin
is_super_admin = (user_role == 'super_admin' or 'admin@t21services' in user_email.lower())

# Allow all staff roles
allowed_roles = ['admin', 'super_admin', 'tutor', 'assessor', 'staff', 'tester', 'teacher', 'instructor', 'trainer']

if user_role not in allowed_roles and not is_super_admin:
    st.warning("⚠️ Document library is only available...")
    return
```
