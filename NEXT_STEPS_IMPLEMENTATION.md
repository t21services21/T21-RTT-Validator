## 🎯 MY RECOMMENDATION

**Start with Option 1 (Launch Data Analyst), then build DS Foundations with revenue.**

**Rationale:**
1. **Validate market** - Prove demand with real paying customers
2. **Generate cash flow** - Fund further development
3. **Get feedback** - Real students improve future pathways
4. **Competitive advantage** - Launch before competitors
5. **Reduce risk** - Don't invest 10 more hours without validation

**Action Plan:**
- **This Week:** Launch Data Analyst (I can help)
- **Next Week:** Support first students, gather feedback
- **Week 3:** If revenue > £30K, hire help AND expand DS Foundations
- **Week 4:** Launch DS Foundations as second pathway
