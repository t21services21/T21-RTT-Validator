# ✅ CDA SUBMISSION DOCUMENT CLEANED!

**Date:** October 24, 2025 10:10 AM  
**Issue:** Document had "FOR TQUK USE ONLY" section  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED - Professional submission document  

---

## 🎯 **WHAT WAS WRONG:**

### **1. "FOR TQUK USE ONLY" Section** ❌
```
FOR TQUK USE ONLY:
Reviewed by: _________________________
Date: _________________________
Decision: ☐ Approved ☐ Approved with amendments ☐ Not approved
Comments: _________________________
Approval Reference: _________________________
```

**Problem:**
- This is for TQUK to fill out AFTER they receive it
- Should NOT be in your submission
- Makes document look like a template, not a submission

### **2. Blank Signature Fields** ❌
```
Signature: _________________________
Name: Tosin Michael Owonifari
```

**Problem:**
- Underscores look unprofessional
- Should be a proper declaration
