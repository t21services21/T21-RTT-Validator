# ENROLLMENT BUG FIXED - NO STUDENTS FOUND

Date: October 24, 2025 5:28 PM
Issue: "No students found" in TQUK Course Assignment
Status: FIXED

---

## THE PROBLEM:

### What Happened:
- You registered learner: Lawunmi Latinwo
- Role: student_ultimate
- Went to TQUK Course Assignment tab
- Saw: "No students found. Add students first in Student Management."

### Why It Happened:
- TQUK Course Assignment was only looking for role = 'student'
- Your learner has role = 'student_ultimate'
- System didn't recognize student_ultimate as a student
- Dropdown was empty

---

## THE FIX:

### What I Changed:

**File:** tquk_course_assignment.py

**Before (Line 157):**
```python
students = supabase.table('users').select('email, full_name, role').eq('role', 'student').execute()
```

**After (Lines 157-161):**
```python
# Get all users and filter for student roles
all_users = supabase.table('users').select('email, full_name, role').execute()
# Include all student types: student, student_basic, student_professional, student_ultimate
student_list = [u for u in (all_users.data if all_users.data else []) 
               if 'student' in u.get('role', '').lower()]
```

### What This Does:
- Gets ALL users from database
- Filters for ANY role containing "student"
- Includes:
  - student
  - student_basic
  - student_professional
  - student_ultimate
- Now all student types appear in dropdown!
