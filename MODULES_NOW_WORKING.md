# ✅ ALL MODULES NOW WORKING!

**Date:** October 14, 2025  
**Issue Fixed:** New modules were not accessible  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

---

## 🔧 What Was Wrong

The 22 new clinical modules existed in the `pages/` directory but were **NOT accessible** because:

1. ❌ They were not listed in the sidebar navigation
2. ❌ They used `render_navigation()` which hid the sidebar
3. ❌ Users had no way to navigate to them

---

Added 22 new modules organized into 3 categories:

### 2. Fixed Navigation System

Updated all 22 modules to:
