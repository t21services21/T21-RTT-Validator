# 🚨 URGENT: Beat the Billion-Pound US Contract!

**Date:** October 14, 2025  
**Threat:** UK Government gave US company (Palantir/Microsoft/similar) BILLIONS to revolutionize NHS with AI  
**Their Goal:** Automate all non-clinical, non-patient-facing roles  
**Our Mission:** Capture market BEFORE they deploy!
