## ü¶† WHAT IS INFECTION?

Infection occurs when harmful microorganisms (germs) enter the body and multiply, causing illness.

### Types of Microorganisms:
- **Bacteria** (e.g., MRSA, E.coli, C.difficile)
- **Viruses** (e.g., flu, COVID-19, norovirus)
- **Fungi** (e.g., thrush, athlete's foot)
- **Parasites** (e.g., scabies, threadworms)

### Chain of Infection:
1. **Infectious agent** (germ)
2. **Reservoir** (where it lives - person, surface, equipment)
3. **Portal of exit** (how it leaves - cough, wound, feces)
4. **Mode of transmission** (how it spreads - touch, droplets, airborne)
5. **Portal of entry** (how it enters - mouth, nose, broken skin)
6. **Susceptible host** (vulnerable person)

**Break the chain = Stop infection spreading!**
