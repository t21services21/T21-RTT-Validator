### **4. CERTIFICATE RELEASE POLICY (UK-Compliant)**

**Legal Basis:**
- TQUK certification is a separate credentialing service
- We are authorized to issue certificates upon meeting TWO conditions:
  1. ✅ Program completion + pass examination
  2. ✅ Full payment of program fees

**This is legal because:**
- It's clearly disclosed upfront (transparency requirement met)
- You agree to terms before enrollment (informed consent)
- Certificate is a separate deliverable from training access
- Similar to withholding degree until tuition paid (standard practice)

**Timeline:**
- **Pay in Full:** Certificate issued 5-7 days after program completion
- **2 Installments:** Certificate issued after month 5 payment + program complete
- **3 Installments:** Certificate issued after month 7 payment + program complete

**Example (2 Installments):**
- Oct 1: Enroll, pay £700
- Nov 15: Complete program, pass exam ✅
- **Certificate withheld** (payment plan incomplete)
- Mar 1: Pay £650 (final payment) ✅
- Mar 3: Certificate issued 🎓

**Your Rights:**
- You can pay remaining balance early to get certificate sooner
- 5% discount offered for early payoff
- Clear communication throughout
