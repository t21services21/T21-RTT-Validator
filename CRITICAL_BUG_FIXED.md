# 🐛 CRITICAL BUG FOUND AND FIXED!

## ❌ **THE PROBLEM YOU DISCOVERED:**

**Maths module was showing ONLY headings, NO content!**

You saw:
- "Numbers & Number System" (just the title)
- "Measures, Shape & Space" (just the title)  
- "Information & Data" (just the title)

**NO actual learning content was displaying!** ❌

---

## 🔍 **ROOT CAUSE:**

### **The Broken Code:**

```python
# OLD BROKEN CODE:
sections = content.split("# ")
for section in sections:
    if section.startswith(section_marker[2:]):
        st.markdown("# " + section)
        break
```

### **Why It Failed:**

1. File starts with `# TQUK Functional Skills Maths Level 1...`
2. Then has `# Numbers & Number System`
3. Code splits by `"# "` creating array of sections
4. Tries to find section starting with `"Numbers & Number System"`
5. **BUG:** The split logic was broken and only showed the heading!

---

## ✅ **THE FIX:**

### **New Working Code:**

```python
# NEW WORKING CODE:
section_start = content.find(section_marker)
next_section = content.find("\n# ", section_start + 1)

if next_section == -1:
    section_content = content[section_start:]
else:
    section_content = content[section_start:next_section]

st.markdown(section_content)
```

### **How It Works:**

1. Find where "# Numbers & Number System" starts
2. Find where the NEXT section starts (next `\n# `)
3. Extract everything between these two points
4. Display the full section content!
