## Current Status (Updated): 
- **Quiz Progress**: ~31% complete (110/350 questions done)
  - ✅ DS Foundations: 70/70 questions (100%)
  - ✅ DS Pathway 2 Units 1-3: 30/30 questions  
  - ⏳ DS Pathway 2 Units 4-7: 40 more questions needed
  - ⏳ DS Pathway 3: 70 questions needed
  - ⏳ Data Analyst: 70 questions needed
  - ⏳ Data Engineer: 70 questions needed
- **Lab Details**: 0% complete (105 labs need step-by-step expansion)
- **Notebooks**: 0% complete (21 notebooks need complete worked examples)
- **Datasets**: ~2% complete (49 more datasets needed)

## What We Have NOW (7-8/10 Quality):
✅ Complete pathway structure (5 pathways × 7 units)
✅ Theory sections (3-4 subsections per unit)
✅ Lab descriptions (2-3 per unit, brief)
✅ 80 world-class quiz questions with explanations
✅ PDFs (study plans, checklists, portfolios)
✅ Notebook scaffolds
✅ Evidence tracking, progress, certificates

## To Reach 10/10 World-Class:
⏳ 270 more quiz questions
⏳ 105 detailed step-by-step lab instructions
⏳ 21 filled notebooks with complete examples
⏳ 50 realistic datasets with data dictionaries
⏳ Video content placeholders
⏳ Interview prep materials
⏳ Case studies

**Estimated completion**: Requires 12-15 more focused building sessions

## Recommendation:
**TEST NOW** with pilot learners, get feedback, then prioritize remaining expansions based on what they need most.
