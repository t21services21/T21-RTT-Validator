# ✅ **FIXED: Student Self-Service Password Reset**

## **🚨 THE PROBLEM:**

Students were seeing: **"Password reset not available. Contact admin@t21services.co.uk"**

**Root Cause:**
- Password reset functions existed
- BUT they only checked local JSON file
- Students are stored in **Supabase database**
- Functions couldn't find Supabase users
- Reset failed silently

---

## **✅ THE FIX:**

### **Updated 2 Functions in `student_auth.py`:**

#### **1. `request_password_reset()` - Line 274**

```python
# NOW CHECKS BOTH:
1. Supabase database (primary)
2. Local JSON file (fallback)

# If user found:
- Generates 6-digit code
- Sends email via SendGrid ✅
- Code valid for 15 minutes
```

#### **2. `reset_password()` - Line 340**

```python
# NOW UPDATES BOTH:
1. Supabase database (if user there)
2. Local JSON file (if user there)

# Updates password hash in correct location
```
