# FIX IJEOMA'S ACCESS - URGENT

Date: October 25, 2025 2:17 PM
Issue: Ijeoma sees RTT training instead of Level 3 content
Root Cause: She doesn't have Level 3 module in her sidebar
Status: NEEDS IMMEDIATE FIX

---

## THE REAL PROBLEM:

Looking at her screenshots:

**Image 1 - Her Sidebar:**
- 🎓 Learning Portal ✅
- ℹ️ Help & Information ✅
- ⚙️ My Account ✅
- 📧 Contact & Support ✅

**MISSING:**
- ❌ 📚 Level 3 Adult Care (NOT IN SIDEBAR!)

**Image 2 - What She Sees:**
- RTT Fundamentals
- RTT Codes
- RTT Training content

**Why?** Because she clicked "Learning Portal" which has RTT content, not "Level 3 Adult Care" which she doesn't have!

---

## THE FIX (DO THIS NOW):

### METHOD 1: SIMPLE COURSE ASSIGNMENT (RECOMMENDED)

1. **Go to:** Teaching & Assessment
2. **Click:** "📚 TQUK Course Assignment" tab (3rd tab)
3. **Select:** Ijeoma Grace Esekhalaye
4. **Tick:** ☑ Level 3 Diploma in Adult Care
5. **Click:** "Assign Selected"
6. **Wait:** 10 seconds
7. **Done!**

This will:
- ✅ Add her to tquk_enrollments table
- ✅ Add "📚 Level 3 Adult Care" to her module_access
- ✅ She'll see it in her sidebar
- ✅ She can click it and access content

## WHY THIS HAPPENED:

### What You Did:

You probably:
1. Registered Ijeoma
2. Applied "Basic Student" preset
3. This gave her: Learning Portal + Help + My Account

### What You Didn't Do:

You didn't:
1. Assign Level 3 Diploma course
2. This is a SEPARATE step!

### The Confusion:

- "Learning Portal" = RTT training content
- "Level 3 Adult Care" = TQUK qualification content
- They are DIFFERENT modules!

---

## VERIFICATION:

### After Assigning, Check:

1. **Go to:** Access Overview
2. **Find:** Ijeoma
3. **Expand:** Her card
4. **Should see:**
   - 🎓 Learning Portal
   - 📚 Level 3 Adult Care ← Should be here now!
   - ℹ️ Help & Information

### Tell Ijeoma:

"I've just assigned you to Level 3. Please:
1. Refresh your page (Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. Look at the sidebar on the left
3. You should now see '📚 Level 3 Adult Care'
4. Click on it
5. Then click 'Learning Materials' tab
6. You'll see all the units!"

## QUICK DIAGNOSTIC:

```bash
python diagnose_ijeoma_access.py
