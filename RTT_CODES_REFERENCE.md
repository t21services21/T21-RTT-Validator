## üìä **Code Sequencing Rules**

### ‚úÖ **Valid Sequences:**
- `10 ‚Üí 20 ‚Üí 20 ‚Üí 30` (Standard pathway)
- `10 ‚Üí 20 ‚Üí 32 ‚Üí 91 ‚Üí 91 ‚Üí 11 ‚Üí 20 ‚Üí 30` (With active monitoring)

## üéØ **Key RTT Terminology**

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **RTT** | Referral to Treatment |
| **PTL** | Patient Tracking List - patients awaiting treatment |
| **DNA** | Did Not Attend |
| **IPT MDS** | Inter Provider Transfer Minimum Data Set |
| **PBL** | Partial Booking List - awaiting first appointment |
| **WL** | Waiting List (for treatment or diagnostics) |
| **TCI** | To Come In date (surgery/diagnostic date) |
| **OPA/OPD** | Outpatient Appointment/Department |
| **AM** | Active Monitoring |
| **FDT** | First Definitive Treatment |
| **AHP** | Allied Health Professional |
| **Nullify** | Make pathway invalid (data quality issue) |

---

## ‚è±Ô∏è **Breach Thresholds**

- **18 weeks** - Standard NHS RTT target
- **26 weeks** - Serious wait breach (escalate)
- **52 weeks** - Critical breach (immediate action required)

**Calculation:** 
- Start date = Referral received (code 10/11/12)
- Stop date = First treatment (30) or discharge (34/35/36)
- Subtract any patient-initiated pause periods (31)
- Provider-initiated pauses (32) depend on trust policy

---

## üìù **Clock Pause vs Stop**

### **Pause (31/32):**
- Clock temporarily stops
- Can restart with code 11
- Time paused does NOT count toward 18-week target
- Patient remains on PTL

### **Stop (30/34/35/36):**
- Clock ends permanently for this pathway
- Pathway closed
- Patient removed from PTL
- Post-treatment follow-ups use code 90
