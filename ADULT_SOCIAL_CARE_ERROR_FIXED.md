# ✅ ADULT SOCIAL CARE - ERROR FIXED!

## 🔧 **PROBLEM:**

KeyError when trying to access optional units - the OPTIONAL_UNITS dictionary was missing required keys:
- `learning_outcomes`
- `activities`
- `file`

## ✅ **SOLUTION:**

Added all missing keys to all 5 optional units (Units 6-10):

```python
OPTIONAL_UNITS = {
    6: {
        "name": "The role of the health and social care worker",
        "ref": "M/601/1690",
        "credits": 2,
        "glh": 13,
        "level": 2,
        "category": "Core Skills",
        "file": "ADULT_SOCIAL_CARE_ALL_UNITS.md",  ← ADDED
        "learning_outcomes": 3,                    ← ADDED
        "activities": 6                            ← ADDED
    },
    # ... same for units 7-10
}
```

## ✅ **WHAT WAS FIXED:**

**File:** `tquk_adult_social_care_module.py`

**Added to each optional unit:**
- ✅ `"file": "ADULT_SOCIAL_CARE_ALL_UNITS.md"`
- ✅ `"learning_outcomes": [number]`
- ✅ `"activities": [number]`
