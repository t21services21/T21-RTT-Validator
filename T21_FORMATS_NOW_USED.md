# ‚úÖ LETTER INTERPRETER NOW USES YOUR T21 FORMATS!

**Date:** October 18, 2025 at 4:17pm  
**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED - Now uses official T21 commenting styles!

---

## **üôè MY APOLOGY:**

**You were absolutely right to be confused and frustrated!**

You DID provide all the commenting styles already in `T21_COMMENT_STYLES.md`!

I was showing generic formats like:
```
18/10/2025 TSO, Referral received 01/10/2025, PT on PBL...
```

When you already had official T21 formats:
```
01/07/2022 T21 - AWAITING 1ST OPA
```

**I apologize for not using your existing formats from the start!**

---

## **üìã YOUR OFFICIAL T21 FORMATS (from T21_COMMENT_STYLES.md):**

### **Clock CONTINUES:**
```
[DATE] T21 - [ACTION/STATUS]
```

**Examples:**
- `01/07/2022 T21 - AWAITING 1ST OPA` (referral, no appointment)
- `03/07/2022 T21 - 1ST OPA 10/12/2022` (appointment booked)
- `01/07/2022 T21 - AWAITING DSG [MRI SCAN]` (diagnostic to book)
- `01/10/2017 T21 - DSG [MRI SCAN] 04/11/2017` (diagnostic booked)
- `01/07/2022 T21 - AWAITING 1CL` (waiting for surgery date)
- `01/07/2022 T21 - 1CL 25/12/2022` (surgery date set)
- `01/07/2022 T21 - AWAITING F/U APPT` (follow-up needed)
- `01/07/2022 T21 - F/U APPT 05/11/2017` (follow-up booked)

### **Clock STOPS:**
```
CS ([STOP_DATE])([RTT_CODE]) [VALIDATOR_INITIALS] REASON FOR CLOCK STOP
```

**Examples:**
- `CS (23/04/2025)(30) JDS PATIENT RCVD MEDICATION/TREATMENT`
- `CS (23/04/2025)(30) JDS PATIENT RCVD MEDICATION/TREATMENT. F/U APPT BOOKED`
- `CS (15/09/2025)(34) MOD PATIENT DISCHARGED - NO TREATMENT REQUIRED`
- `CS (20/08/2025)(35) AKM PATIENT DECLINED TREATMENT`

---

## **‚úÖ WHAT I FIXED:**

### **1. AI Prompt Updated**

Now includes YOUR T21 formats in the prompt:

```python
T21 OFFICIAL COMMENT FORMATS:

CLOCK CONTINUES: [DATE] T21 - [ACTION]
Examples:
- AWAITING 1ST OPA (referral, no appointment yet)
- 1ST OPA [DATE] (first appointment booked)
- AWAITING DSG [TEST NAME] (diagnostic test to be booked)
- DSG [TEST NAME] [DATE] (diagnostic booked)
- DXG [TEST NAME] [DATE] (diagnostic done)
- AWAITING 1CL (waiting for surgery TCI date)
- 1CL [DATE] (surgery date set)
- AWAITING F/U APPT (follow-up needed)
- F/U APPT [DATE] (follow-up booked)

CLOCK STOPS: CS ([STOP_DATE])([CODE]) [INITIALS] REASON
Examples:
- CS (23/04/2025)(30) JDS PATIENT RCVD MEDICATION/TREATMENT. F/U APPT BOOKED
- CS (15/09/2025)(34) MOD PATIENT DISCHARGED - NO TREATMENT REQUIRED
```

### **2. Step 5 Comment Format**

Now shows:

**üìã T21 OFFICIAL FORMATS:**
- Clock CONTINUES: `[DATE] T21 - [ACTION]`
- Clock STOPS: `CS ([DATE])([CODE]) [INIT] REASON`

**üìå REFERRAL Examples:**
- No appointment booked: `18/10/2025 T21 - AWAITING 1ST OPA`
- Appointment booked: `18/10/2025 T21 - 1ST OPA [DATE]`

**üíä TREATMENT Examples:**
- No follow-up: `CS ([DATE])(30) [INIT] PATIENT RCVD MEDICATION/TREATMENT`
- Follow-up BOOKED: `CS ([DATE])(30) [INIT] PATIENT RCVD MEDICATION/TREATMENT. F/U APPT BOOKED`
- Follow-up NOT booked: `CS ([DATE])(30) [INIT] PATIENT RCVD MEDICATION/TREATMENT. F/U APPT REQUIRED`

### **3. Step 6 Actions**

Now includes checks for ALL scenarios:

1. **For REFERRALS:** Check PBL ‚Üí Use `AWAITING 1ST OPA` or `1ST OPA [DATE]`
2. **For TREATMENT:** Check if follow-up booked ‚Üí Use `F/U APPT BOOKED` or `F/U APPT REQUIRED`
3. **For DIAGNOSTICS:** Check if test booked ‚Üí Use `DSG [TEST]` or `AWAITING DSG [TEST]`
4. **For SURGERY:** Check if TCI set ‚Üí Use `1CL [DATE]` or `AWAITING 1CL`

---

## **üéØ WHAT VALIDATORS SEE NOW:**

### **For Referral Letter:**

**Step 5: NHS Comment Format**
- Shows T21 format: `[DATE] T21 - AWAITING 1ST OPA`
- Two examples: No appointment vs Appointment booked
- Critical point: CHECK PBL first, then use correct format based on what you FIND

### **For Treatment Letter:**

**Step 5: NHS Comment Format**
- Shows T21 format: `CS ([DATE])(30) [INIT] PATIENT RCVD MEDICATION/TREATMENT`
- Three examples: No follow-up, Follow-up booked, Follow-up NOT booked
- Critical point: CHECK appointment system first, comment what you FIND

### **For Discharge Letter:**

**Step 5: NHS Comment Format**
- Shows T21 format: `CS ([DATE])(34) [INIT] PATIENT DISCHARGED - NO TREATMENT REQUIRED`

---

## **üìä COMPARISON:**

### **BEFORE (Generic - WRONG):**
```
18/10/2025 TSO, Referral received 01/10/2025, PT on PBL/outpatient waiting list, awaiting OPD appointment
```

### **AFTER (T21 Official - CORRECT):**
```
18/10/2025 T21 - AWAITING 1ST OPA
```

OR if appointment booked:
```
18/10/2025 T21 - 1ST OPA 25/10/2025
```

---

### **BEFORE (Generic - WRONG):**
```
18/10/2025 TSO, Treatment received 10/10/2025, follow-up appointment booked
```

### **AFTER (T21 Official - CORRECT):**
```
CS (10/10/2025)(30) TSO PATIENT RCVD MEDICATION/TREATMENT. F/U APPT BOOKED
```
