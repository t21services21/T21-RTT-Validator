## üìã CODES 10-21 (Clock Start - GREEN)

### Code 10 - 1st Activity After Referral in RTT
- **Clock Status:** Clock Start
- **18 Week RTT Code:** 10
- **Color:** GREEN
- **Description:** 1st activity after referral in RTT
- **When Used:**
  - Any referral from GPs or Dentists as the patient's referral is registered
  - For the first appointment in a new patient pathway
  - If adding a patient directly to a waiting list (without any outpatient appointment)
- **Example:** Used by admin teams to log all new referrals to a consultant-led service. Also could be used by clinician for starting another course of treatment under the same consultant

### Code 11 - 1st Activity After Watchful Wait Ends
- **Clock Status:** Clock Start
- **18 Week RTT Code:** 11
- **Color:** GREEN
- **Description:** 1st activity after watchful wait ends (end of active monitoring)
- **When Used:** If a patient has been on active monitoring and treatment is now needed. 1st activity at the start of a new period is the 1st activity
- **Example:** Patient has been counselled for a hip replacement but wants to see how it goes. Some time later they come back and want to go ahead. A new clock would start

### Code 12 - Consultant Referral for a New Condition
- **Clock Status:** Clock Start
- **18 Week RTT Code:** 12
- **Color:** GREEN
- **Description:** Consultant referral for a new condition
- **When Used:** When a consultant referral for a new condition is added to the existing pathway

## üìã CODE 20 (Clock Still Ticking - YELLOW)

### Code 20 - Subsequent Activity Along the 18-Week Pathway
- **Clock Status:** Clock still ticking

  - Request for Phlebotomy, Cardiology assessment, any type of imaging, Urodynamic assessment, Endoscopy, Neurophysiology, Nuclear Medicine, Sleep Studies, Audiology
  - Additions to a Waiting List
- **Examples:**

## üéØ VALIDATION RULES BASED ON CODES

### Clock Start Codes (Must Be First):
- **10** - 1st activity after referral
- **11** - 1st activity after watchful wait ends
- **12** - Consultant referral for new condition

### Clock Still Ticking (Can Repeat):
- **20** - Subsequent activity (most common!)
- **21** - Tertiary referral

### Clock Stop Codes (Must Be Last):
- **30** - 1st definitive treatment
- **31** - Watchful wait by patient
- **32** - Watchful wait by clinician
- **33** - Patient DNA 1st activity
- **34** - Decision not to treat
- **35** - Patient declines treatment
- **36** - Patient deceased

## ‚úÖ VALIDATION LOGIC FOR AI

### Rule 1: Code Sequence Must Be Valid
```
Valid Sequences:
‚úÖ 10 ‚Üí 20 ‚Üí 20 ‚Üí 30 (referral ‚Üí activity ‚Üí activity ‚Üí treatment)
‚úÖ 10 ‚Üí 20 ‚Üí 31 (referral ‚Üí activity ‚Üí patient watchful wait)
‚úÖ 11 ‚Üí 20 ‚Üí 30 (restart after watchful wait ‚Üí activity ‚Üí treatment)
‚úÖ 10 ‚Üí 33 (referral ‚Üí patient DNA)

Invalid Sequences:
‚ùå 20 ‚Üí 10 (activity before referral - WRONG!)
‚ùå 30 ‚Üí 20 (treatment then activity - WRONG!)
‚ùå 10 ‚Üí 10 (duplicate referral - WRONG!)
‚ùå 31 ‚Üí 20 (watchful wait then activity - WRONG!)
```

### Rule 2: Clock Start Must Come First
- First code MUST be 10, 11, or 12
- Cannot have 20 before 10
- Cannot have 30 before 10

### Rule 3: Clock Stop Must Come Last
- Codes 30-36 must be final code
- Cannot have 20 after 30
- Cannot have multiple clock stops

### Rule 4: Code 20 Can Repeat
- Code 20 can appear multiple times
- Represents ongoing pathway activity
- Most common code in a pathway

### Rule 5: Diagnostic Tests = Code 20
- Phlebotomy = 20
- Imaging = 20
- Endoscopy = 20
- ANY diagnostic test = 20
- **NEVER stops the clock!**

## ü§ñ AI AUTO-VALIDATOR MUST CHECK:

1. ‚úÖ **Code sequence is chronologically valid**
2. ‚úÖ **First code is 10, 11, or 12**
3. ‚úÖ **Last code is 30-36 (if pathway complete)**
4. ‚úÖ **No code 20 after clock stop**
5. ‚úÖ **No duplicate clock starts**
6. ‚úÖ **No duplicate clock stops**
7. ‚úÖ **Dates match code sequence**
8. ‚úÖ **Code matches activity type**
9. ‚úÖ **Diagnostic tests coded as 20**
10. ‚úÖ **Watchful wait codes used correctly**

---

## üí° COMMON ERRORS TO AUTO-FIX:

### Error 1: Wrong Code for Diagnostic Test
- **Error:** Imaging coded as 30 (treatment)
- **Auto-Fix:** Change to 20 (activity)
- **Confidence:** 100%

### Error 2: Missing Code 10
- **Error:** Pathway starts with code 20
- **Auto-Fix:** Add code 10 at start
- **Confidence:** 95%

### Error 3: Activity After Treatment
- **Error:** Code 20 after code 30
- **Auto-Fix:** Change 20 to 90 (post-treatment)
- **Confidence:** 100%

### Error 4: Wrong Watchful Wait Code
- **Error:** Code 31 but clinician decided
- **Auto-Fix:** Change to 32
- **Confidence:** 90%

## üéØ THIS IS WHAT TRUE VALIDATION MEANS!

**Now I understand the REAL NHS codes!**

Every validation must check:
- ‚úÖ Correct code sequence (10 ‚Üí 20 ‚Üí 30)
- ‚úÖ Correct code for activity type
- ‚úÖ Correct clock status
- ‚úÖ Diagnostic tests = Code 20 (NEVER stop clock!)
- ‚úÖ Watchful wait codes used correctly
- ‚úÖ No invalid combinations

**This is 1000000000x smarter validation!** üöÄ
