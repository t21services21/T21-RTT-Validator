## 📊 NHS NUMBER VALIDATION:

### **How It Works:**

NHS numbers use **Modulus 11 checksum validation**:

```
Example: 943 476 5919

Step 1: Multiply first 9 digits by weights 10-2
9×10 + 4×9 + 3×8 + 4×7 + 7×6 + 6×5 + 5×4 + 9×3 + 1×2 = 253

Step 2: Calculate remainder
253 ÷ 11 = 23 remainder 0

Step 3: Calculate check digit
11 - 0 = 11 → becomes 0

Step 4: Verify
Check digit (0) doesn't match last digit (9)
→ INVALID!

Valid example: 943 476 5870
```

**System validates automatically!** ✅

---

## 💾 DATA STORAGE:

### **Option 1: Supabase (Production)**
```
Patients table:
- patient_id (primary key)
- nhs_number
- demographics
- contacts
- user_email (multi-tenant)

Episodes table:
- episode_id (primary key)
- episode_type (consultant/treatment/diagnostic)
- patient_id (foreign key)
- episode details
- user_email (multi-tenant)
```

### **Option 2: Local JSON (Fallback)**
```
patients_registered.json
episodes.json
```

**Automatic fallback if Supabase unavailable!** ✅
