### **Hybrid Mode: Mix and Match**

**Staff can set DIFFERENT modes for DIFFERENT students:**

```python
Student A: 🟢 Auto-Submit (trusted, good data)
Student B: 🟡 Review Mode (new, checking quality)

Student E: 🟡 Review Mode (complex sponsorship situation)
```

**Toggle anytime:**

---

## **4️⃣ DATA IMPORT FROM LEARNERS** ✅

### **Three Import Methods - You Choose**

---

### **METHOD 1: BULK EXCEL IMPORT** 📥
**Best for: 10+ students at once**

**Step 1:** Export template
```python
from job_automation.student_data_import import StudentDataImporter

importer = StudentDataImporter()
importer.export_template_excel('student_template.xlsx')
```

**Step 2:** Fill Excel with learner data from:
- ✅ T21 training records
- ✅ Student enrollment forms
- ✅ TQUK completion records
- ✅ Contact information database

**Excel columns:**
```
First Name, Last Name, Email, Phone, Address, City, Postcode
NHS Number, Date of Birth, Immigration Status, Requires Sponsorship
Qualifications, Employment History, TQUK Completion Date
Preferred Locations, Preferred Bands
```

**Step 3:** Import all at once
```python
results = importer.import_from_excel('completed_data.xlsx')
# ✅ 50 students imported in 2 minutes!
```

**What you get from learners:**
- Student enrollment forms (you already have these)
- T21 course completion records
- Contact details
- Immigration status (from course registration)
- Qualifications (from course application)

---

### **METHOD 2: MANUAL WEB FORM** 📝
**Best for: 1-5 students, one at a time**

**Open staff dashboard → Click "Add Student" → Fill form**

**Data needed (you already have from T21 records):**
- Personal details (from enrollment)
- TQUK completion date (from course records)
- Qualifications (from application)
- Contact info (from database)
- Job preferences (ask student or use defaults)

**Time:** 5 minutes per student

---

### **METHOD 3: STAFF FILLS FIRST APPLICATION** ✍️
**Best for: Learning the system, complex students**

**Process:**
1. Create basic student profile (minimal info)
2. Staff manually fills first Trac application
3. Take notes of what was entered
4. Import that data into system
5. Future applications = automated!

**Benefit:** Staff learns exactly what data is needed

---

## **📊 COMPLETE DATA FLOW**

### **What Data You Need (All from Existing T21 Records)**

```
