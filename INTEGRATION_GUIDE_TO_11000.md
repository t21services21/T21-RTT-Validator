def render_data_science_pathway3_module():
```

**Step 4:** Save and verify line count:
```bash
python -c "with open('data_science_pathway3_module.py', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f: print(f'Lines: {len(f.readlines()):,}')"
```

---

### **OPTION B: Use Pre-Made Integration File (5 minutes)**

I can create a single comprehensive file with all content properly formatted that you can copy-paste directly into the module.

**Command:**
```
Create FINAL_INTEGRATION_CONTENT.txt with all 3,584 lines ready to paste
```

---

### **OPTION C: Automated Script (1 minute)**

Create and run an integration script:

```python
# integrate_final_content.py
def integrate_content():
    # Read current file
    with open('data_science_pathway3_module.py', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        lines = f.readlines()
    
    # Find insertion point (before render function)
    insert_index = None
    for i, line in enumerate(lines):
        if 'def render_data_science_pathway3_module():' in line:
            insert_index = i
            break
    
    # Load comprehensive content
    with open('FINAL_INTEGRATION_CONTENT.txt', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        new_content = f.readlines()
    
    # Insert content
    lines = lines[:insert_index] + new_content + lines[insert_index:]
    
    # Write back
    with open('data_science_pathway3_module.py', 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        f.writelines(lines)
    
    print(f"✅ Integration complete!")
    print(f"New line count: {len(lines):,}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    integrate_content()
```

Run: `python integrate_final_content.py`
