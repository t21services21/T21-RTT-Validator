  - Discharge (DISCH.../34)
  - Decision to Treat (DTT.../20)
- Automatic capitalization
- Action-oriented wording
- GP letter status inclusion
- Follow-up date/period extraction

### What It Does:
Generates professional, standardised PAS comment lines in T21 format that can be directly copied into clinical systems.

**Example outputs:**
```
CS20/02/2025/30 – FDT STARTED (SEPTOPLASTY). PATHWAY CLOSED. GP LETTER SENT.
AM32/10/01/2025 – UNDER REVIEW 12W. FU BOOKED 10/04/2025.
DNA33/15/01/2025 – FIRST CARE DNA. REBOOK 2W. GP COPY PENDING.
WL/TCI 20/02/2025 – TCI SET. CONTINUE 20.
```

### Features:
- RTT clock fundamentals
- Clock pause vs stop rules
- Complete RTT code reference table
- Breach thresholds (18/26/52 weeks)
- Policy references
- Training reminders

### What It Does:
Quick-reference guide embedded in the app for staff to review RTT rules without leaving the validation environment.

## 🧮 **Advanced Features Built In**

### NHS Number Validation
- **Modulus 11 checksum algorithm** implemented
- Validates 10-digit format
- Detects invalid check digits
- Example: `1234567881` → Valid ✅

### Code Repetition Rules
- Code 10 → Once only (initial pathway start)
- Code 11 → Restarts clock after Active Monitoring/Watchful Wait ends
- Code 12 → Starts new clock for NEW condition (Consultant/AHP referral)
- Code 20 → Multiple times before 30
- Code 21 → Tertiary referral (transfer responsibility)
- Code 30, 34, 35, 36 → Once only per pathway (stops)
- Code 31/32 → Once per AM phase (pauses clock)
- Code 91 → Multiple during AM (requires prior 31/32)
- Code 90 → Multiple post-treatment (non-RTT)
- Code 92 → Diagnostics only (non-RTT)
- Code 98 → Not applicable to RTT
- Code 20 after 30 → Flagged as error (should be 90)

### Breach Calculation
- 18 weeks → Standard target
- 26 weeks → Serious breach
- 52 weeks → Critical breach
- Automatic adjustment for patient-initiated pauses

### Active Monitoring Logic
- 31 = Patient-initiated
- 32 = Clinician-initiated
- 91 = Activity during AM (only valid if 31/32 exists)
- Clock pauses during AM
- Clock restarts when treatment decision made
