# ✅ BOTH MATHS LEVELS FIXED!

## 🎯 **SINGLE FIX, DOUBLE IMPACT**

The fix I applied to `tquk_functional_skills_maths_module.py` fixes **BOTH Level 1 AND Level 2** at the same time!

---

## 🔧 **HOW IT WORKS:**

### **The Code:**
```python
with open(f"tquk_functional_skills_maths_{level.lower().replace(' ', '_')}_content.md", "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
```

### **What This Does:**
- When `level = "Level 1"` → Opens `tquk_functional_skills_maths_level_1_content.md`
- When `level = "Level 2"` → Opens `tquk_functional_skills_maths_level_2_content.md`

**Same code, different files!** ✅
