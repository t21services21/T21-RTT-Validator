## **🔧 HOW TO DELETE:**

### **Step 1: Go to All Materials Tab**
```
Learning Materials
├─ Upload Material (tab 1)
└─ All Materials (tab 2) ← Click here
```

### **Step 2: Find Material to Delete**
```
Total Materials: 15

📄 Old Material - Week 1
📄 Outdated Slides - Week 2
📄 Wrong File - Week 3  ← Want to delete this one
```

### **Step 3: Click Delete**
```

```

---

## **💡 SOFT DELETE vs HARD DELETE:**

### **Soft Delete (Current Implementation):**
```python
# Mark as deleted, don't actually remove
supabase.table('learning_materials').update({
    'status': 'deleted'
}).eq('id', material_id).execute()
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Can be recovered if deleted by mistake
- ✅ Audit trail preserved
- ✅ Download history maintained
- ✅ Safer (can't permanently lose data)

**Database After Delete:**
```
| id | title      | status   |
|----|------------|----------|
| 1  | File A     | active   | ← Students see this
| 2  | File B     | deleted  | ← Students DON'T see this
| 3  | File C     | active   | ← Students see this
```

**Query Filter:**
```python
# Only shows active materials (deleted ones hidden)
.select('*').eq('status', 'active')
```

---

### **Hard Delete (Optional - More Permanent):**

If you want PERMANENT deletion, change code to:
```python
# Permanently delete from database
supabase.table('learning_materials').delete().eq('id', material_id).execute()

# Also delete from storage
supabase.storage.from_('learning_materials').remove([file_path])
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Free up storage space
- ✅ Truly remove incorrect materials
- ✅ Clean database

**Drawbacks:**
- ❌ Can't recover if mistake
- ❌ Lose download history
- ❌ Audit trail lost

---

## **🔐 SECURITY:**

### **Who Can Delete?**
- ✅ **Admins:** YES (see delete button)
- ❌ **Teachers:** Currently YES (if they see teacher view)
- ❌ **Students:** NO (different view, no delete button)

### **Permission Check:**
```python
# In render_learning_materials()
is_teacher = 'admin' in user_email or 'teacher' in user_email

if is_teacher:
    render_materials_teacher(user_email)  # Has delete button
else:
    render_materials_student(user_email)  # No delete button
```

### **Recommendations:**

**Option 1: Admin-Only Delete**
```python
# Only admins can delete
is_admin = 'admin' in user_email

if is_admin:
    # Show delete button
    if st.button("🗑️ Delete", ...):
        ...
```

**Option 2: Creator-Only Delete**
```python
# Only person who uploaded can delete
if material.get('uploaded_by') == user_email:
    # Show delete button
    if st.button("🗑️ Delete", ...):
        ...
```
