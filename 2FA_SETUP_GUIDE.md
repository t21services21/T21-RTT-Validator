## 🚀 DEPLOYMENT STEPS

### Step 1: Add Database Columns

**You MUST run this SQL script in Supabase before 2FA will work!**

1. Go to: https://supabase.com
2. Login and select your project
3. Click **"SQL Editor"** (left sidebar)
4. Click **"New Query"**
5. **Copy the entire contents** of `ADD_2FA_COLUMNS.sql`
6. **Paste** into the query editor
7. Click **"Run"**
8. You should see: "Success. No rows returned"

**This adds 4 new columns to your users table:**
- `two_factor_secret` - Stores the TOTP secret
- `two_factor_backup_codes` - Stores backup codes (JSON)
- `two_factor_enabled` - Boolean flag
- `two_factor_enabled_at` - Timestamp

### Step 2: Push to GitHub

**Files to push (7 new/modified files):**

1. `requirements.txt` - Added pyotp, qrcode, pillow
2. `two_factor_auth.py` - NEW - 2FA core functions
3. `supabase_database.py` - Added 2FA database functions
4. `pages/2fa_setup.py` - NEW - 2FA setup UI page
5. `app.py` - Integrated 2FA into login flow
6. `ADD_2FA_COLUMNS.sql` - NEW - Database migration script
7. `2FA_SETUP_GUIDE.md` - NEW - This file

**Commit message:**
```
Implement Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) with TOTP support
```

## 🔑 HOW 2FA LOGIN WORKS

### Before 2FA:
```
User enters: Email + Password → Login ✅
```

### After 2FA Enabled:
```
User enters: Email + Password
           ↓
System asks: "Enter 6-digit code from your app"
           ↓
User enters: 123456 (from authenticator)
           ↓
           Login ✅
```

### If User Loses Phone:
```
User clicks: "Use Backup Code"
           ↓
Enters: ABCD-1234 (one of 10 backup codes)
           ↓
       Login ✅

## 💼 BUSINESS VALUE

### Revenue Impact:

**With 2FA:**
- Can charge **£300/user/month** (Enterprise tier)
- Meet NHS enterprise security requirements
- Win tenders that require MFA (Multi-Factor Auth)
- Differentiate from competitors

**Without 2FA:**
- Limited to **£150/user/month** maximum
- Cannot bid on enterprise contracts
- Higher insurance costs
- Risk of data breach

### ROI Example:
```
200 users × £300/month = £60,000/month
                       = £720,000/year
vs
200 users × £150/month = £30,000/month
                       = £360,000/year

2FA adds: £360,000 ARR potential! 💰

## 🐛 TROUBLESHOOTING

### "Invalid 2FA code"

**Causes:**
- Code expired (codes change every 30 seconds)
- Phone clock is wrong (fix: sync phone time)
- Scanned wrong QR code

**Solution:**
- Make sure phone time is set to automatic
- Wait for next code (30 seconds)
- Try backup code instead

### "Backup code doesn't work"

**Causes:**
- Code already used (each code works once)
- Typo in code (check XXXX-XXXX format)

**Solution:**
- Contact admin to reset 2FA
- Try different backup code

### "Lost Phone - Can't Login"

**Solution:**
1. Click "Use Backup Code"
2. Enter one of your saved backup codes
3. Once logged in, go to 2FA settings
4. Reset 2FA to generate new QR code
5. Scan with new phone
