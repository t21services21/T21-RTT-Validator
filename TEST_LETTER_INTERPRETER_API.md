# 🧪 TESTING CLINIC LETTER INTERPRETER

## **🚨 CURRENT PROBLEM:**

Letter Interpreter is showing **GENERIC output** instead of actual analysis!

### **Signs it's broken:**
- ❌ "NHS Number: Not extracted"
- ❌ "Specialty: Not extracted"  
- ❌ "What Happened: Analyze letter content" (should be specific!)
- ❌ Comment has [PLACEHOLDERS] not actual values
- ❌ "Confidence: Medium" (should be HIGH)

---

## **💡 THE CAUSE:**

OpenAI API is not configured OR not working, so system falls back to generic templates.

---

## **✅ HOW TO FIX:**

### **Step 1: Check API Key**

1. Go to Streamlit Cloud Dashboard
2. Your app → Settings → Secrets
3. Check if `OPENAI_API_KEY` exists
4. Should look like: `OPENAI_API_KEY = "sk-proj-..."`

### **Step 2: Add API Key if Missing**

Same key used for Interview Prep!

```
OPENAI_API_KEY = "sk-your-actual-key-here"
```

### **Step 3: Restart App**

After adding key, click "Reboot app" in Streamlit Cloud.
