- ✅ **Valid** - Demonstrates what it claims to
- ✅ **Authentic** - Your own work

- ✅ **Sufficient** - Covers all learning outcomes

**Ask yourself:**
- Does it clearly show I can do/understand this?
- Have I explained which learning outcomes it covers?
- Is it detailed and specific?
- Does it show real workplace practice?
