# 🚀 NHS JOB AUTOMATION - COMPLETE BACKEND SETUP

## ✅ **WHAT I JUST BUILT:**

### **3 BACKEND PROCESSES:**

1. **NHS Jobs Scraper** (`nhs_jobs_scraper.py`)
   - Scrapes NHS Jobs website
   - Finds matching positions based on student preferences
   - Stores in `discovered_jobs` table
   - Filters by location, band, sponsorship

2. **AI Application Generator** (`ai_application_generator.py`)
   - Uses GPT-4 to generate supporting information
   - Creates unique, tailored content for each job
   - Stores in `applications` table with "queued" status
   - Respects daily application limits

3. **Trac Auto-Submitter** (`trac_auto_submitter.py`)
   - ALREADY EXISTS! (I found it)
   - Logs into NHS Trac
   - Fills complete application form
   - Submits automatically

### **RUNNER & UI:**

4. **Automation Cycle Runner** (`run_automation_cycle.py`)
   - Runs all 3 steps in sequence
   - Can be run manually or scheduled
   - Includes system test function

5. **Manual Runner UI** (`manual_runner_ui.py`)
   - Streamlit interface for admins
   - Click buttons to run each step
   - See real-time progress
   - View recent applications

---

## ⚙️ **CONFIGURATION:**

### **1. Environment Variables / Streamlit Secrets:**

Add to `.streamlit/secrets.toml`:

```toml
SUPABASE_URL = "your-supabase-url"
SUPABASE_KEY = "your-supabase-key"
OPENAI_API_KEY = "sk-your-openai-api-key"
ENCRYPTION_KEY = "your-fernet-encryption-key"
```

### **2. Generate Encryption Key:**

```python
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet
key = Fernet.generate_key()
print(key.decode())  # Add this to secrets as ENCRYPTION_KEY
```

---

## 🎮 **HOW TO USE:**

### **METHOD 1: Manual Runner UI (EASIEST)**

1. **Deploy the code**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Complete backend: scraper, AI generator, manual runner"
   git push
   ```

2. **Wait 30 seconds for Streamlit to update**

3. **Login as admin**

4. **Go to: Career Development → Job Automation → Manual Runner tab**

5. **Click buttons:**
   - "🔍 RUN SCRAPER" - Find NHS jobs
   - "🤖 RUN AI GENERATOR" - Create applications
   - "🚀 RUN FULL CYCLE" - Run both

6. **Watch it work!**

---

### **METHOD 2: Command Line**

Run manually from terminal:

```bash
# Full cycle
python -m job_automation.run_automation_cycle

# Just scrape
python -c "from job_automation.nhs_jobs_scraper import scrape_jobs_for_all_students; scrape_jobs_for_all_students()"

# Just generate
python -c "from job_automation.ai_application_generator import generate_applications_for_all_students; generate_applications_for_all_students()"

# System test
python -m job_automation.run_automation_cycle test
```

---

### **METHOD 3: Scheduled (GitHub Actions)**

Create `.github/workflows/job_automation.yml`:

```yaml
name: NHS Job Automation

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 */6 * * *'  # Every 6 hours
  workflow_dispatch:  # Manual trigger

jobs:
  automate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v2
        with:
          python-version: 3.9
      
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          pip install -r requirements.txt
      
      - name: Run automation cycle
        env:
          SUPABASE_URL: ${{ secrets.SUPABASE_URL }}
          SUPABASE_KEY: ${{ secrets.SUPABASE_KEY }}
          OPENAI_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}
          ENCRYPTION_KEY: ${{ secrets.ENCRYPTION_KEY }}
        run: |
          python -m job_automation.run_automation_cycle
```

**Add secrets to GitHub:**
1. Go to repository Settings → Secrets → Actions
2. Add: `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ENCRYPTION_KEY`

## 🧪 **TESTING:**

### **Test 1: System Check**
```bash
python -m job_automation.run_automation_cycle test
```

Should show:
```
✅ Supabase connected
✅ Found X active students
✅ Y jobs in database
✅ OpenAI API key found
```

### **Test 2: Manual Scrape**
```python
from job_automation.nhs_jobs_scraper import scrape_nhs_jobs

jobs = scrape_nhs_jobs(
    locations=['London'],
    bands=['Band 3', 'Band 4'],
    requires_sponsorship=False
)

print(f"Found {len(jobs)} jobs")
```

### **Test 3: Manual AI Generation**
```python
from job_automation.ai_application_generator import create_applications_for_student

created = create_applications_for_student(
    student_id='your-student-uuid-here',
    max_applications=1
)

print(f"Created {created} applications")
```

## 🔥 **COST ESTIMATE:**

**OpenAI API (GPT-4):**

- 100 applications = $1.50
- 1000 applications = $15

**Very affordable!**
