# Data Science Foundations (Pathway 1)
## Suggested 8-Week Study Plan

This plan assumes a learner studying **8–10 hours per week** alongside other
commitments. Tutors can adjust pacing for faster or slower groups.

- Get familiar with the platform, notebooks, and datasets.

**Activities**
- Read: Unit 1 in the app (Course Overview + Learning Materials).
- Lab: `U1_intro_exploration.ipynb` (explore UK/US datasets).
- Reflection: short written answers in the notebook.

---

## Week 2 – Unit 2: Python Basics

**Goals**
- Build core Python skills for data work.

**Activities**
- Read: Unit 2 in the app.

## Week 3 – Unit 3: Pandas & NumPy (Part 1)

**Goals**
- Learn how to load, inspect and clean tabular data with Pandas.

**Activities**
- Read: Unit 3 in the app.
- Lab: `U3_pandas_cleaning_uk_retail.ipynb` (sections 1–4).

---

## Week 4 – Unit 3: Pandas & NumPy (Part 2)

**Goals**
- Produce grouped summaries and prepare clean tables for analysis.

**Activities**
- Lab: finish `U3_pandas_cleaning_uk_retail.ipynb` (sections 5–7).
- Tutor check-in on cleaning decisions and business summaries.

## Week 5 – Unit 4: SQL for Analysis

**Goals**
- Query relational data with core SQL patterns.

**Activities**
- Read: Unit 4 in the app.
- Lab: `U4_sql_queries_foundations_db.ipynb`.
- Short quiz on basic SQL concepts (if available).

---

## Week 6 – Unit 5: Statistics & A/B Testing

**Goals**
- Understand basic stats and how to analyse a simple experiment.

**Activities**
- Read: Unit 5 in the app.
- Lab: `U5_ab_testing_web.ipynb`.
- Written summary: explain the test results to a non-technical manager.

---

## Week 7 – Unit 6: Visualisation & Storytelling

**Goals**
- Create clear charts and communicate insights.

**Activities**
- Read: Unit 6 in the app.
- Lab: `U6_basic_charts.ipynb`.
- Prepare 1–2 slides or a short written narrative based on the charts.

---

## Week 8 – Unit 7: Capstone Project

**Goals**
- Complete an end-to-end mini project suitable for a portfolio.

**Activities**
- Read: Unit 7 in the app.
- Lab: `U7_capstone_template.ipynb`.
- Submit capstone project as evidence via the platform.

---

## Tutor Notes

- Encourage learners to **save notebooks regularly** and back up to GitHub.
- Use weekly check-ins to review reflections and answer questions.
- Learners who finish early can start extending the capstone or exploring
  additional datasets (UK, US, and global).
