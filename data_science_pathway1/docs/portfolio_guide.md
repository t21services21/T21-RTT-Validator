# Portfolio Guide – Data Science Foundations (Pathway 1)

This guide helps learners turn their work in Pathway 1 into a **job-ready
portfolio** that can support applications in the UK, US and globally.

---

## 1. Why a portfolio matters

- Shows real evidence of your skills beyond certificates.
- Gives hiring managers something concrete to discuss in interviews.
- Helps you remember projects and examples for competency questions.

Even for junior roles, a small but **well-presented** portfolio can make a
big difference.

## 2. What to include from Pathway 1

At minimum, learners should include:

1. **Unit 3 – Cleaning UK Retail Data**
   - Notebook: `U3_pandas_cleaning_uk_retail.ipynb` (cleaned and polished).
   - Clean dataset: `uk_retail_sales_clean.csv`.

2. **Unit 5 – Web A/B Test Analysis**
   - Notebook: `U5_ab_testing_web.ipynb` with clear interpretation.

3. **Unit 7 – Capstone Project**
   - Completed `U7_capstone_template.ipynb`.
   - Optional: a short PDF or slide deck summarising the project.

Learners may also add any extra experiments or datasets they work on.

## 3. Organising your GitHub repository

Suggested structure for a public GitHub repo:

```text
data-science-foundations-portfolio/
  README.md
  data/
    uk_retail_sales_clean.csv
    other_datasets...
  notebooks/
    U3_pandas_cleaning_uk_retail_final.ipynb
    U5_ab_testing_web_final.ipynb
    capstone_project.ipynb
  reports/
    capstone_summary.pdf
```

Key tips:

- Use clear file names ending in `_final` for polished work.
- Add a top-level `README.md` explaining each project in 1–2 paragraphs.
- Remove temporary or very rough notebooks from the public repo.

## 4. Writing about your projects

For each project, include a short description covering:

1. **Problem** – What business question were you answering?
2. **Data** – What dataset(s) did you use? What does one row represent?
3. **Approach** – What techniques and tools did you use?
4. **Results** – What were the main findings or recommendations?
5. **Skills shown** – e.g. Python, Pandas, SQL, statistics, visualisation.

Learners can reuse and adapt the text they wrote in the capstone template.

---

## 5. Linking to CV and LinkedIn

- Add a line in the **Projects** or **Experience** section of the CV:
  - "Data Science Foundations Portfolio – projects in Python, Pandas, SQL,
     statistics and visualisation (GitHub link)."
- On LinkedIn, add a **Featured** item linking directly to the GitHub repo
  or to a web-hosted version of the capstone report.

## 6. Tutor checklist for portfolio readiness

- [ ] At least one cleaned dataset and one end-to-end notebook.
- [ ] Clear explanations in English that non-technical readers can follow.
- [ ] No obvious typos in titles or headings.
- [ ] No sensitive or real patient/customer data used – only training data.
- [ ] GitHub repo is public and link is easy to share.

When these boxes are ticked, the learner is ready to present this portfolio
when applying for junior data roles or apprenticeships.
