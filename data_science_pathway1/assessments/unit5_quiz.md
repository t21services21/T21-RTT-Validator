   true.  
C. The probability that the variant is better.  
D. The proportion of users who converted.

**Correct answer:** B

---

**Q8.** Which of the following is an example of **sampling bias**?

A. Measuring conversion rates over a full month.  
B. Only surveying customers who left positive reviews.  
C. Using random numbers in a simulation.  
D. Reporting results with a chart.

---

**Q10.** In the context of A/B testing, what does it mean if a result is
"not statistically significant" at your chosen threshold?

A. The test must have been set up incorrectly.  
B. There is not enough evidence to confidently say there is a real
   difference.  
C. The variant is definitely worse than control.  
D. The sample size is always too small.

**Correct answer:** B

---

## Section B – Short Answer (5 questions)

**Q11.** Explain in 2–3 sentences the difference between **correlation** and
**causation**.

**Model answer (guide):**  
Correlation means two variables move together, but it does not prove that one
causes the other. Causation means changing one variable directly influences
the other. Many real-world relationships are correlated because of hidden or
third factors.

---

**Q12.** Give one practical UK or US example where you might run an **A/B
 test** in a digital product.

**Model answer (guide):**  
For example, testing two versions of a homepage banner for an online
retailer, or two versions of an appointment reminder email for a healthcare
provider.

---

**Q13.** Why is **sample size** important when interpreting A/B test
results?

**Model answer (guide):**  
With a very small sample, random chance can create large-looking differences
in conversion that are not real. Larger samples reduce this noise and give
more reliable estimates.

---

**Q14.** Give one example of a situation where an **average** might be
misleading and another measure (like median) would be better.

**Model answer (guide):**  
Average income in a region can be distorted by a few very high earners, so
the median is often better for representing a typical person.

---

**Q15.** In your own words, explain why understanding basic statistics is
important for data professionals when communicating with non-technical
stakeholders.

**Model answer (guide):**  
It helps you judge whether patterns are real or random, choose appropriate
metrics, and explain uncertainty clearly so that managers can make informed
decisions.
