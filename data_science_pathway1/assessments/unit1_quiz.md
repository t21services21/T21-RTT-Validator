Learners should answer in 2–4 sentences. Tutors can mark these manually.

**Q11.** In your own words, explain the difference between a **Data Analyst** and a **Data Scientist**.

**Model answer (guide):**  
A Data Analyst focuses more on reporting, dashboards and descriptive analysis of what has happened. A Data Scientist designs experiments and builds predictive or classification models to estimate what might happen next or to automate decisions.

**Q12.** Give one example of a data science question in the **UK** and one in the **US** (any sector).

**Model answer (guide):**  
UK example: analysing A&E waiting time patterns across NHS trusts.  
US example: predicting customer churn for a subscription streaming service.

---

**Q13.** Why is it dangerous to jump straight into modelling without spending time on **Data Understanding** and **Data Preparation**?

**Model answer (guide):**  
If you do not understand or clean the data, models may be trained on incorrect, missing or biased information. This leads to misleading results and poor decisions, even if the model appears technically accurate.

---

**Q14.** Describe one situation where using data science **unethically** could harm people.

**Model answer (guide):**  
For example, using historical recruitment data that contains hidden gender or racial bias to automatically filter CVs. The model might unfairly reject qualified candidates from certain groups, repeating past discrimination.

---

**Q15.** Why is clear **communication** an essential part of a data scientist’s job?

**Model answer (guide):**  
Non-technical stakeholders need to understand the insights in plain language to make decisions. If results are not explained clearly, good analysis may be ignored or misused, so communication is as important as the technical work.
