# ✅ OPTIONAL UNITS TEXT FIXED!

## 🎯 **ISSUE FOUND AND FIXED:**

### **The Problem:**
The Optional Units tab was showing **hardcoded text** that said:
- ❌ "You've already completed **7 mandatory units (24 credits)**"
- ❌ "Now choose **34 credits** from the optional units below"

This was correct for Level 3, but **wrong for Level 2** which has:
- ✅ 5 mandatory units (16 credits)
- ✅ Need 4 optional credits

---

## ✅ **THE FIX:**

Updated `tquk_optional_units.py` to make the text **dynamic** based on the course:

### **Before (Hardcoded):**
```python
st.info("""
**📋 How to Complete This Qualification:**
- ✅ You've already completed 7 mandatory units (24 credits)
- 🎯 Now choose **34 credits** from the optional units below
...
""")
```

### **After (Dynamic):**
```python
# Calculate optional credits needed
optional_credits_needed = required_credits - mandatory_credits

# Determine number of mandatory units based on course
if course_id == "level2_business_admin":
    mandatory_units_count = 5
else:
    mandatory_units_count = 7

st.info(f"""
**📋 How to Complete This Qualification:**
- ✅ You've already completed {mandatory_units_count} mandatory units ({mandatory_credits} credits)
- 🎯 Now choose **{optional_credits_needed} credits** from the optional units below
...
""")
```
