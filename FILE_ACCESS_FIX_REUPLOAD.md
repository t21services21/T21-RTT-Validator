# ⚠️ **FILES NEED TO BE RE-UPLOADED**

## **🔍 THE PROBLEM:**

Student clicks View/Download → **"We can't open this file"** error

---

## **🎯 ROOT CAUSE:**

**Timeline:**
1. ❌ Files uploaded with OLD code (public URLs - broken)
2. ✅ Code deployed with FIX (signed URLs - works)
3. ❌ OLD files still have OLD broken URLs in database
4. ❌ Students try to access OLD files → ERROR!

**The Fix (signed URLs) ONLY works for NEW uploads!**

---

## **✅ THE SOLUTION:**

### **RE-UPLOAD ALL MATERIALS!**

You need to delete old materials and upload them again with the new code.

---

## **📋 STEP-BY-STEP FIX:**

### **Step 1: Identify Old Materials**

All materials uploaded **BEFORE** the last deployment (today) are broken.

Check URL in browser:
- ❌ Broken: `.../object/public/learning_materials/...`
- ✅ Works: `.../object/sign/learning_materials/...?token=...`

---

### **Step 2: Delete Old Materials**

**As Admin:**
```
1. Go to Learning Materials
2. Click "All Materials" tab
3. Find old material (e.g., "RTT CODED")
4. Click 🗑️ Delete
5. Repeat for all old materials
```

---

### **Step 3: Re-Upload Files**

**As Admin:**
```
1. Go to "Upload Material" tab
2. Select file(s) to upload (can select multiple!)
3. Fill in:
   - Title: "RTT CODED"
   - Category: "Lecture Notes"
   - Week: 1
   - Description: (your description)
4. Click "Upload Material(s)"
5. Wait for "✅ File uploaded successfully!"
6. See confirmation with file links
```

---

### **Step 4: Test as Student**

**As Student:**
```
1. Login as student
2. Go to Learning Materials
3. Expand material
4. Click "👁️ View File" → ✅ Opens in browser!
5. Click "📥 Download" → ✅ Downloads file!
```

---

## **🔧 WHAT I ALSO FIXED:**

### **Download Button Now Works:**

**BEFORE (Broken):**
```
Download button → Track download → Show message
→ But file doesn't actually download!
```

**AFTER (Fixed):**
```
Download button → Direct link to file
→ Browser downloads file immediately! ✅
```

**Change:** Download button is now a direct link (like View button)

---

## **💡 WHY FILES MUST BE RE-UPLOADED:**

### **Database Structure:**

```sql
learning_materials table:
| id | title     | file_url                                    |
|----|-----------|---------------------------------------------|
| 1  | Old File  | /public/learning_materials/file.pdf        | ← BROKEN (public URL)
| 2  | New File  | /sign/learning_materials/...?token=xyz123  | ← WORKS (signed URL)
```

**The URL is stored in database when file is uploaded!**

Old uploads → Stored public URL (broken)  
New uploads → Store signed URL (works)

**Can't fix old URLs without re-uploading!**
