================================================================================

❌ Hard to click on mobile
❌ Confusing - could check multiple boxes
❌ Bad user experience

✅ Replaced with BIG RADIO BUTTONS!
✅ Click anywhere on the option to select
✅ Only one portal can be selected at a time

================================================================================

✅ FIX #2: STAFF LOGIN KEYERROR FIXED!

PROBLEM:
❌ KeyError when logging in as staff
❌ Error: USER_TYPES[role] - 'staff' key not found
❌ Database had role="staff"
❌ But USER_TYPES only had "staff_trainer" and "staff_support"
❌ Mismatch caused crash!

ROOT CAUSE:
Database entry: "role": "staff"
USER_TYPES dictionary: Only had "staff_trainer", "staff_support", "admin"
Missing: Plain "staff" role!

SOLUTION 1: Added "staff" role to USER_TYPES ✅
Now USER_TYPES includes:
- student_trial
- student_basic
- student_professional
- student_ultimate
- staff_trainer
- staff_support
- admin
- super_admin
- staff ← NEW! (Full admin access)

SOLUTION 2: Added graceful error handling ✅
If role not found:
- If role contains "admin" or "staff" → Default to "admin"
- Otherwise → Default to "student_trial"
- Never crashes! Always has fallback!

RESULT:
✅ Staff login now works!
✅ Admin login works!
✅ All roles supported!
✅ Graceful fallback for unknown roles!
✅ No more KeyErrors!
