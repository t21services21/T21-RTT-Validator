# ✅ **LEARNING MATERIALS UX FIXES**

## **🎯 TWO ISSUES FIXED:**

### **Issue 1: Students Could Only Download, Not View**
**Problem:** Students saw only "Download" button. File link appeared only AFTER clicking Download.

**User Asked:** "Students can now see upload but it says download only. Is that how it should work so student can't view and download?"

**Fix:** Students now see BOTH buttons side-by-side:
- **👁️ View File** - Opens file directly in browser
- **📥 Download** - Tracks download + opens file

---

### **Issue 2: Admin Success Message Disappeared**
**Problem:** After upload, success message showed then page refreshed (`st.rerun()`), making it look like upload might have failed.

**User Said:** "When I upload from admin it say successfully and disappear. This can mislead sometime. Why admin we not know if this upload successfully? It suppose to show not just show for seconds and disappear."

**Fix:** 
- Removed `st.rerun()` - success message stays visible
- Added upload confirmation with all details
- Shows link to view uploaded file
- Tells admin to check "All Materials" tab

---

## **✅ CHANGES MADE:**

### **1. Student View (lines 239-271):**

**BEFORE:**
```python
# Download button only
if st.button(f"📥 Download", key=f"dl_{material.get('id')}"):
    # Track download
    ...
    st.markdown(f"[**🔗 Open File**]({material['file_url']})")
    st.success("Download tracked!")
```
**Problem:** File link only appeared AFTER clicking Download!

**AFTER:**
```python
# Show VIEW and DOWNLOAD buttons directly
col1, col2 = st.columns(2)

with col1:
    # View button - opens file in new tab
    st.markdown(f"[**👁️ View File**]({material['file_url']})")

with col2:
    # Download button - tracks download
    if st.button(f"📥 Download", key=f"dl_{material.get('id')}"):
        # Track download
        ...
        st.success("✅ Download tracked!")
```
**Solution:** Both buttons visible immediately!

---

### **2. Admin View (lines 172-186):**

**BEFORE:**
```python
supabase.table('learning_materials').insert(material_data).execute()
st.success("✅ Material uploaded successfully!")
st.balloons()
st.rerun()  # ← PAGE REFRESHES! Message disappears!
```
**Problem:** Success message visible for 1 second then disappears!

**AFTER:**
```python
result = supabase.table('learning_materials').insert(material_data).execute()
st.success("✅ Material uploaded successfully!")
st.balloons()

# Show uploaded material details
if result.data:
    uploaded = result.data[0]
    st.info(f"""✅ **Upload Confirmed:**
    - **Title:** {uploaded.get('title')}
    - **Category:** {uploaded.get('category')}
    - **Week:** {uploaded.get('week')}
    - **File:** {uploaded.get('file_name')}
    
    📊 Go to "All Materials" tab to see all uploaded files.""")
    st.markdown(f"[🔗 View Uploaded File]({uploaded.get('file_url')})")
```
**Solution:** Success message persists + shows upload details + link to verify!
