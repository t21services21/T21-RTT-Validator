# ✅ ADULT SOCIAL CARE - FIXED & NOW VISIBLE!

## 🎯 **PROBLEM FOUND AND FIXED:**

### **Issue:**
Adult Social Care was added to super_admin, admin, and staff roles but **NOT to the tester role**.

Since you're logged in as a **tester**, you couldn't see it!

### **Solution:**
Added "🏥 Adult Social Care" to the tester's accessible_modules list.
