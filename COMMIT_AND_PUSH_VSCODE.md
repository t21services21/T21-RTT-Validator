# üöÄ HOW TO COMMIT AND PUSH USING VS CODE

## **THE ROOT CAUSE:**
The `user_role` wasn't being detected correctly because it's stored in `st.session_state.user_license.role`, not `st.session_state.user_role`.

## **WHAT I FIXED:**
Updated all 4 TQUK modules to check multiple possible locations for user_role:
1. st.session_state.user_license.role (main location)
2. st.session_state.user_role (fallback)
3. st.session_state.user_type (fallback)
4. Check if email contains 'admin@t21services' (super admin override)

## **FILES CHANGED:**
- tquk_level3_adult_care_module.py
- tquk_it_user_skills_module.py
- tquk_customer_service_module.py
- tquk_business_admin_module.py
