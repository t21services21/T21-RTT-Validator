# üêõ NAVIGATION BUG - FIXED!

## Problem Found
The other AI (ChatGPT) created **duplicate navigation code** in 5 pages, causing the navigation bar to completely break.

## What Was Broken
Each affected page had:
1. **Its own HTML/CSS navigation bar** (65+ lines of code)
2. **PLUS a call to `render_navigation()`**

This created **TWO navigation bars stacking on top of each other**, causing:
- Broken layout
- Missing buttons
- Text labels floating in wrong positions
- Incomplete page rendering

## Files Fixed (5 pages)
1. ‚úÖ `pages/about.py` - Removed 63 lines of duplicate navigation
2. ‚úÖ `pages/pricing.py` - Removed 63 lines of duplicate navigation
3. ‚úÖ `pages/testimonials.py` - Removed 63 lines of duplicate navigation
4. ‚úÖ `pages/leadership.py` - Removed 63 lines of duplicate navigation
5. ‚úÖ `pages/why_t21.py` - Removed 63 lines of duplicate navigation

**Total cleanup:** ~315 lines of duplicate/conflicting code removed

## What Was Done
Removed all duplicate HTML/CSS navigation code, keeping only:
```python
render_navigation(current_page="page_name")
```

## Status
‚úÖ **FIXED** - Navigation should now work correctly across all pages

## Test It
1. Refresh your browser
2. Visit: https://t21-healthcare-platform.streamlit.app
3. Click navigation buttons (ABOUT, SERVICES, PRICING, CONTACT, etc.)
4. All pages should load with proper navigation
