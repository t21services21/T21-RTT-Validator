## 🎯 **HOW TO MANAGE STUDENTS:**

### **OPTION 1: MANUAL MANAGEMENT (Current Setup)**

**When student wants to upgrade:**
1. They contact you (email/phone)
2. They pay via bank transfer/PayPal
3. You run this Python command:

```python
from student_auth import upgrade_student

# Upgrade student
success, message = upgrade_student(
    email="student@example.com",
    new_role="professional"  # or "basic", "ultimate"
)
print(message)
```

**To extend a license:**
```python
from student_auth import extend_student_license

# Extend by 30 days
success, message = extend_student_license(
    email="student@example.com",
    days=30
)
print(message)
```

**To view all students:**
```python
from student_auth import list_all_students

students = list_all_students()
for student in students:
    print(f"{student['email']} - {student['role']} - {student['status']}")
```

---

### **OPTION 2: ADMIN PANEL (Coming Next)**

I can build you an admin dashboard where you can:
- View all students
- Upgrade students (click button)
- Extend licenses
- Generate license keys
- View revenue
- See usage statistics
- Export student data

**Would you like me to build this?**

## 💰 **REVENUE TRACKING:**

### **How to Track Revenue:**

```python
from student_auth import load_users
from access_control import ROLES

users = load_users()

total_revenue = 0
for email, user in users.items():
    role = user['license']['role']
    if role in ROLES:
        price = ROLES[role]['price']
        total_revenue += price

print(f"Total Revenue: £{total_revenue:,}")
```

---

## 🔑 **LICENSE KEY SYSTEM:**

### **How License Keys Work:**

1. **Auto-Generated:** System creates unique key when student registers
2. **Format:** `XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX`
3. **Stored:** In `users_database.json`
4. **Activation:** Students can enter key to upgrade

### **Manual License Key Generation:**

```python
from access_control import generate_license_key

# Generate key for a student
key = generate_license_key(
    email="student@example.com",
    role="professional",
    duration_days=180
)

print(f"License Key: {key}")
# Give this to student
```

---

## 📊 **DATA STORAGE:**

All student data is stored in: `users_database.json`

**Structure:**
```json
{
  "student@example.com": {
    "user_id": "abc123",
    "email": "student@example.com",
    "password_hash": "hashed_password",
