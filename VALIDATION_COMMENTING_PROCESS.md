# üìù VALIDATION COMMENTING PROCESS - The REAL Workflow

**Date:** October 14, 2025  
**Purpose:** Document what comments are REALLY for  
**Key:** Comments are what YOU WRITE after validation, not what you read!

---

## üéØ THE REAL PROCESS

### VALIDATION WORKFLOW:

**STEP 1: Read Source Documents**
- Read clinic letters (if available)
- Read consultation notes
- Read diagnostic reports
- Read appointment outcomes
- Read operation notes

**STEP 2: Check PAS Data**
- Compare letter vs PAS
- Check if episodes recorded
- Check if codes correct
- Check if dates accurate

**STEP 3: Validate & Update PAS**
- Add missing episodes
- Correct wrong codes
- Fix incorrect dates
- Update waiting times

**STEP 4: WRITE VALIDATION COMMENT**
- Document what you found
- Document what you did
- Document what's missing
- Document next steps
