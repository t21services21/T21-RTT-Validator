```python
interview_prep_rag.record_interview_outcome(
    job_title="Medical Secretary",
    job_description="...",
    questions_generated=[...],  # What we gave them
    questions_appeared=[...],   # What actually came up
    outcome="Got the job! üéâ",
    company_name="Hospital Trust",
    industry="NHS/Healthcare"
)
```

**What It Does:**
- ‚úÖ Anonymizes job description
- ‚úÖ Records which questions appeared
- ‚úÖ Tracks success rate
- ‚úÖ Saves successful patterns
- ‚úÖ Updates question likelihoods

---

**2. Likelihood Adjustment**
```python
adjustment = interview_prep_rag.get_likelihood_adjustment(
    question="Can you explain your experience with medical terminology?",
    category="Technical",
    job_title="Medical Secretary"
)

# Returns:
{
    'has_data': True,
    'adjusted_likelihood': '92%',  # Was 85%, now 92% based on real data
    'adjustment_level': 'VERY HIGH',
    'reason': 'Appeared in 8/10 similar interviews',
    'sample_size': 10
}
```

**How It Works:**

        'priority': 'high'
    },
    {
        'type': 'top_questions',
        'message': 'Top 3 questions for Medical Secretary:',
        'questions': [
            'Can you explain your experience with medical terminology?',
            'How do you handle confidential information?',
            'Describe your typing speed and accuracy'
        ],
        'priority': 'high'
    }
]
```

**Use Case:**
- Shows candidates what REALLY gets asked

**4. Enhanced Question Sets**
```python
enhancement = interview_prep_rag.get_enhanced_question_set(
    job_title="Medical Secretary",
    job_description="...",
    industry="NHS/Healthcare"
)

# Returns:
{
    'has_learning_data': True,
    'similar_interviews_count': 5,
    'common_questions': {
        'Can you explain your experience with medical terminology?': '80%',
        'How do you handle confidential information?': '60%'
    },
