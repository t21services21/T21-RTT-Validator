**GLH:** 18 hours  
**Credits:** 3  
**Level:** 3

## ü©π WHAT ARE PRESSURE ULCERS?

Pressure ulcers (also called pressure sores, bedsores, pressure injuries) are damage to skin and underlying tissue caused by prolonged pressure.

### How They Develop:

**Pressure:**
- Weight of body compresses tissue
- Reduces blood flow
- Cells don't get oxygen and nutrients
- Tissue dies

**Shear:**
- Skin moves in one direction, tissue in another
- Damages blood vessels
- E.g., sliding down in chair

**Friction:**
- Rubbing against surface
- Damages top layer of skin
- E.g., dragging across bed

### Common Sites:

**Lying on Back:**
- Heels
- Sacrum (tailbone)
- Elbows
- Back of head
- Shoulder blades

**Lying on Side:**
- Ankles
- Knees
- Hips
- Shoulders
- Ears

**Sitting:**
- Buttocks (ischial tuberosities)
- Heels
- Spine

**Other:**
- Any bony prominence
- Medical devices (catheters, oxygen tubing, splints)

## üìä IMPACT

### For Healthcare:

**Cost:**

## üéØ PRESSURE ULCER GRADING

### Category 1:

**Non-blanchable erythema**
- Intact skin
- Red area that doesn't turn white when pressed
- May be warm, painful, firm, soft
- Difficult to see on dark skin

### Category 2:

**Partial thickness skin loss**
- Shallow open ulcer
- Red/pink wound bed
- May be blister (intact or burst)
- No slough

### Category 3:

**Full thickness skin loss**
- Deeper ulcer
- Subcutaneous fat visible
- Slough may be present
- May have undermining/tunneling
- Bone/tendon not visible

### Category 4:

**Full thickness tissue loss**
- Very deep ulcer
- Bone, tendon, muscle exposed
- Slough or eschar may be present
- Often undermining/tunneling
- Can extend into muscle, bone

### Unstageable:

**Depth unknown**
- Full thickness loss
- Base covered by slough or eschar
- Can't see depth until removed

### Deep Tissue Injury:

**Suspected deep tissue damage**
- Purple or maroon area
- Intact skin or blood blister
- Damage to underlying tissue
- May evolve to Category 3 or 4

## üõ°Ô∏è PREVENTION

### Risk Assessment:

**When:**
- On admission
- Daily if high risk
- Weekly if moderate risk
- When condition changes
- After surgery

**Tools:**
- Waterlow score
- Braden scale
- Clinical judgment

**Action:**
- Document risk
- Implement prevention strategies
- Review regularly

### Skin Assessment:

**Daily:**
- Inspect all skin
- Especially pressure areas
- Look for redness, damage
- Feel for warmth, firmness
- Document
- Report concerns

**In Dark Skin:**
- May not see redness
- Feel for warmth, firmness
- Look for color changes (purple, blue)
- Ask about pain

### Repositioning:

**Frequency:**
- Every 2-4 hours (individual assessment)
- More often if very high risk
- Less often if low risk
- Document

**Positions:**
- 30-degree tilt (not 90-degree side-lying)
- Avoid lying directly on pressure ulcer
- Use pillows to support
- Heels off bed (pillow under calves)

**Sitting:**
- Reposition hourly
- Stand/walk if able
- Pressure-relieving cushion

**Moving and Handling:**
- Use equipment (slide sheets, hoists)
- Don't drag
- Reduce shear and friction

### Pressure-Relieving Equipment:

**Mattresses:**
- Foam (low risk)
- Air (medium-high risk)
- Alternating pressure (high risk)
- Correct for weight and risk

**Cushions:**
- Foam
- Gel

- Heel protectors
- NOT doughnut cushions (increase pressure)

**Other:**
- Bed rails (positioning, not restraint)

### Skin Care:

**Keep Clean:**
