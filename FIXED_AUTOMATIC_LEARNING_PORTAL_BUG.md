# FIXED: AUTOMATIC LEARNING PORTAL BUG

Date: October 25, 2025 2:21 PM
Issue: Students seeing Learning Portal (RTT training) even when not assigned
Root Cause: System automatically giving Learning Portal to all students
Status: FIXED

---

## THE BUG:

### What Was Happening:

When you assigned a student Level 3 Adult Care, the system was ALSO automatically giving them:
- 🎓 Learning Portal (contains RTT training)
- ℹ️ Help & Information

**Result:** Students saw RTT training content even though you only assigned them Level 3!

---

## WHERE THE BUG WAS:

### Location 1: app.py (Lines 1560-1561)

**OLD CODE (WRONG):**
```python
if user_modules:
    accessible_modules = user_modules + accessible_modules
else:
    # Fallback if no modules in database - show Learning Portal only
    accessible_modules = ["🎓 Learning Portal"] + accessible_modules  # ← BUG!
```

**NEW CODE (CORRECT):**
```python
if user_modules:
    accessible_modules = user_modules + accessible_modules
# If no modules assigned, they only see basic modules (My Account, Help, Contact)
# NO automatic Learning Portal - they only see what you assign!
```

---

### Location 2: app.py (Lines 1563-1568)

**OLD CODE (WRONG):**
```python
except Exception as e:
    # Fallback to basic access if database check fails
    accessible_modules = [
        "🎓 Learning Portal",  # ← BUG!
        "⚙️ My Account",
        "ℹ️ Help & Information",
        "📧 Contact & Support"
    ]
```

**NEW CODE (CORRECT):**
```python
except Exception as e:
    # Fallback to basic access if database check fails
    # Only show basic modules - NO automatic content
    accessible_modules = [
        "⚙️ My Account",
        "ℹ️ Help & Information",
        "📧 Contact & Support"
    ]
```

---

### Location 3: simple_course_assignment.py (Lines 73-76)

**OLD CODE (WRONG):**
```python
BASIC_ACCESS = {
    "learning_portal": "🎓 Learning Portal",  # ← BUG!
    "help": "ℹ️ Help & Information"
}
```

**NEW CODE (CORRECT):**
```python
BASIC_ACCESS = {
    "help": "ℹ️ Help & Information"
}
# NOTE: Learning Portal removed from basic access
# Students only get modules you explicitly assign them!
```

---

## THE LOGIC NOW:

### What Students See:

**ALWAYS (Automatic):**
- ⚙️ My Account
- ℹ️ Help & Information
- 📧 Contact & Support

**ONLY WHAT YOU ASSIGN:**
- 📚 Level 3 Adult Care (if you assign it)
- 🎓 Learning Portal (if you assign it)
- 💼 Career Development (if you assign it)
- 📄 CV Builder (if you assign it)
- 🏥 RTT modules (if you assign them)

**NOTHING AUTOMATIC!** ✅
