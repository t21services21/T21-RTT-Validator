# üîß **FIX: Storage Upload Error (Bucket Exists)**

## **‚úÖ CONFIRMED: Bucket Exists!**

Your screenshot shows:
- ‚úÖ `learning_materials` bucket exists
- ‚úÖ It's PUBLIC
- ‚úÖ Created yesterday

**So why is upload failing?**

---

## **üîç MOST LIKELY ISSUE: STORAGE POLICIES**

Even though the bucket exists, it probably has **NO POLICIES** configured, which blocks all uploads!

---

## **‚úÖ SOLUTION: ADD STORAGE POLICIES**

### **METHOD 1: Via Supabase Dashboard (EASIEST)**

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard**
   - https://supabase.com/dashboard/
   - Select: T21-RTT-Validator project

2. **Navigate to Storage Policies**
   - Click **"Storage"** (left sidebar)
   - Click on **"learning_materials"** bucket
   - Click **"Policies"** tab at the top

3. **Add 4 Policies:**

---

#### **Policy 1: Allow Public Read (View/Download)**
```
Click: "New Policy" ‚Üí "Create a policy"

Policy name: Public can view files
Allowed operation: SELECT
Target roles: public

Policy definition:
bucket_id = 'learning_materials'

Click: "Review" ‚Üí "Save policy"
```

---

#### **Policy 2: Allow Authenticated Users to Upload**
```
Click: "New Policy" ‚Üí "Create a policy"

Policy name: Authenticated users can upload
Allowed operation: INSERT
Target roles: authenticated

Policy definition:
bucket_id = 'learning_materials'

Click: "Review" ‚Üí "Save policy"
```

---

#### **Policy 3: Allow Users to Update Own Files**
```
Click: "New Policy" ‚Üí "Create a policy"

Policy name: Users can update own files
Allowed operation: UPDATE
Target roles: authenticated

Policy definition:
bucket_id = 'learning_materials' AND owner = auth.uid()

Click: "Review" ‚Üí "Save policy"
```

---

#### **Policy 4: Allow Users to Delete Own Files**
```
Click: "New Policy" ‚Üí "Create a policy"

Policy name: Users can delete own files
Allowed operation: DELETE
Target roles: authenticated

Policy definition:
bucket_id = 'learning_materials' AND owner = auth.uid()

Click: "Review" ‚Üí "Save policy"
```

---

### **METHOD 2: Via SQL Editor (ADVANCED)**

Go to **SQL Editor** in Supabase and run:

```sql
-- Policy 1: Public Read
CREATE POLICY "Public can view files"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
TO public
USING (bucket_id = 'learning_materials');

-- Policy 2: Authenticated users can upload
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can upload"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'learning_materials');

-- Policy 3: Users can update own files
CREATE POLICY "Users can update own files"
ON storage.objects FOR UPDATE
TO authenticated
USING (bucket_id = 'learning_materials' AND owner = auth.uid());

-- Policy 4: Users can delete own files
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete own files"
ON storage.objects FOR DELETE
TO authenticated
USING (bucket_id = 'learning_materials' AND owner = auth.uid());
```

---

## **üß™ VERIFY POLICIES:**

After adding policies, run this SQL:

```sql
SELECT 
  policyname,
  cmd,
  roles
FROM pg_policies
WHERE schemaname = 'storage'
  AND tablename = 'objects'
  AND policyname LIKE '%learning_materials%';
```

Should return 4 rows:
```
policyname                          | cmd    | roles
------------------------------------|--------|----------------
Public can view files               | SELECT | {public}
Authenticated users can upload      | INSERT | {authenticated}
Users can update own files          | UPDATE | {authenticated}
Users can delete own files          | DELETE | {authenticated}
```

---

## **üîç OTHER POSSIBLE ISSUES:**

### **Issue 2: Authentication Problem**

If policies don't fix it, the issue might be authentication. Check:

**In `supabase_database.py`:**
```python
# Make sure Supabase client is initialized with user auth
supabase = create_client(
    supabase_url,
    supabase_key,
    options={
        'auth': {
            'autoRefreshToken': True,
            'persistSession': True
        }
    }
)
```

---

### **Issue 3: File Path Problem**

Current code uses:
```python
file_path = f"learning_materials/{user_email}/{uploaded_file.name}"
```

This might fail if `user_email` contains special characters. Try:

```python
import re
safe_email = re.sub(r'[^a-zA-Z0-9@._-]', '_', user_email)
file_path = f"learning_materials/{safe_email}/{uploaded_file.name}"
```

---

### **Issue 4: File Already Exists**

If file already exists, upload might fail. Solution:

```python
# Add timestamp to filename to make it unique
import time
timestamp = int(time.time())
file_name_parts = uploaded_file.name.rsplit('.', 1)
unique_name = f"{file_name_parts[0]}_{timestamp}.{file_name_parts[1]}"
file_path = f"learning_materials/{user_email}/{unique_name}"
```

---

## **üìä UPDATED ERROR DISPLAY:**

I've updated the code to show the ACTUAL error instead of generic message.

**Now when you try to upload, you'll see:**
```
‚ùå Upload Error: [actual error message]
Error Type: [error type]
üîç Debug Info - Click to see full error
```

This will tell us exactly what's wrong!

---

## **üöÄ TESTING STEPS:**

1. **Add Storage Policies** (Method 1 or 2 above)
2. **Restart Streamlit app** (if running locally)
3. **Try upload again**
4. **If still fails**, check the error message (now shows actual error)
5. **Send me the error message** and I'll fix it!

---

## **‚è±Ô∏è QUICK CHECKLIST:**

- [ ] Bucket exists ‚úÖ (confirmed in screenshot)
- [ ] Bucket is public ‚úÖ (confirmed in screenshot)
- [ ] Storage policies added ‚ùì (do this now!)
- [ ] Test upload
- [ ] Check error message if fails
- [ ] Report actual error for further help

---

## **üéØ MOST LIKELY FIX:**

**90% chance the issue is missing storage policies!**

Go to:
```
Supabase Dashboard 
‚Üí Storage 
‚Üí learning_materials 
‚Üí Policies tab
‚Üí Should see 4 policies
‚Üí If empty, add the 4 policies above!
```

---

## **üí° WHY THIS HAPPENS:**

When you create a bucket:
- ‚úÖ Bucket is created
- ‚úÖ Public access is enabled
- ‚ùå But NO policies exist yet!

**Without policies = no one can upload!**

---

**Add the policies and try again!** ‚úÖ

Then report back what error you see (if any) with the new detailed error display!
