# ✅ HELP & INFORMATION - CONTENT SEPARATED!

Documentation and RTT rules

📖 About RTT Rules

RTT (Referral to Treatment) 18-Week Standard:
- Maximum wait from referral to treatment start
- Clock starts on referral received or first consultation
- Clock stops on treatment start or patient removes themselves
...
```

**This is WRONG! TQUK students don't need RTT information!** ❌

---

## ✅ **THE FIX:**

**Made Help & Information page show different content based on user type:**

### **For RTT Students:**
- ✅ RTT Rules and regulations
- ✅ 18-Week Standard information
- ✅ Active/Paused pathway concepts
- ✅ Breach definitions

### **For TQUK Students:**
- ✅ TQUK Qualification information
- ✅ How to use the platform
- ✅ Learning materials guidance
- ✅ Evidence submission help
- ✅ TQUK Approved Centre info

### **For Everyone:**
- ✅ Technical support contact
- ✅ Course support guidance
- ✅ Help resources

## 📊 **HOW IT WORKS:**

### **Detection Logic:**

```python
# Check if user has RTT access
user_email = st.session_state.get('user_email', '')

# Get user's enrollments
enrollments = get_learner_enrollments(user_email)
enrolled_courses = [e['course_id'] for e in enrollments]

# Check if user has ANY TQUK courses
tquk_courses = ['level3_adult_care', 'level2_it_skills', 'level2_customer_service', 
                'level2_business_admin', 'level2_adult_social_care', 'level3_teaching_learning',
                'functional_skills_english', 'functional_skills_maths']
has_tquk_only = any(course in enrolled_courses for course in tquk_courses)

# Check if user has RTT access (not TQUK-only)
has_rtt_access = not has_tquk_only or len(enrolled_courses) == 0

if has_rtt_access:
    # Show RTT content
else:
    # Show TQUK content
```
