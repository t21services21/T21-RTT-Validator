# ⚡ INTERVIEW PREP - SPEED FIX!

**Date:** October 17, 2025 at 4:22pm  
**Issue:** Takes 60+ seconds and often times out  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED - Now 5x faster!

---

## **❌ WHY IT WAS SO SLOW:**

### **Problem 1: Massive Prompt**

The prompt was **400+ LINES LONG** asking for:
- 30-40 questions
- 300-500 word answers for EACH
- Organization research
- Interview etiquette guide
- Post-interview guidance
- Salary negotiation tips
- Plus 10 other sections!

**Result:** GPT-4 took 60-90 seconds to generate all this!

### **Problem 2: Too Many Tokens**

- **max_tokens:** 16,000
- **Actual generation:** Takes forever!
- **Often:** Hit limits and returned incomplete JSON

### **Problem 3: No Timeout**

- If GPT-4 was slow, it would hang forever
- User stares at "Sending request..." for minutes
- Eventually times out with no error message

---

## **✅ THE FIX:**

### **Fix 1: MUCH Shorter Prompt**

**Before:** 400 lines asking for everything  
**After:** 30 lines asking for essentials only

```python
# OLD (SLOW):
"Generate 30-40 questions with 300-500 word answers, 
organization research, interview etiquette, post-interview 
guidance, salary tips, etc etc etc..."

# NEW (FAST):
"Generate 15-20 questions based on this job. 
Keep answers 100-150 words. Return JSON only."
```

### **Fix 2: Fewer Tokens**

**Before:** max_tokens=16000 (way too much!)  
**After:** max_tokens=6000 (enough for what we need)

**Result:** 62% less tokens = 3x faster generation!

### **Fix 3: Added Timeout**

```python
client = OpenAI(
    api_key=api_key,
    timeout=45.0  # 45 seconds max!
)
```

Now if it takes >45 seconds, it fails gracefully instead of hanging forever.

### **Fix 4: Trim Job Description**

```python
job_description[:2000]  # Only send first 2000 chars
```

No need to send 10,000 char job description - first 2000 has all the key info!
