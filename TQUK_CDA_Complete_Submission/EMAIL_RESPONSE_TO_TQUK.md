## 🎯 ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGY CLARIFICATION

### 1. Learning Content (Study Materials)
- Comprehensive theory and knowledge
- Real-world examples and case studies
- Best practice guidance
- Regulatory framework
- Interactive activities

### 2. Assessment Activities (Evidence Generation)
Each unit uses multiple assessment methods for triangulation:

- **Observation** - Assessor watches learner work in care setting
- **Professional Discussion** - Assessor questions learner on knowledge
- **Witness Statement** - Colleagues confirm competence
- **Reflective Account** - Learner reflects on practice
- **Product Evidence** - Care plans, risk assessments, documents created by learner
- **Case Study Analysis** - Learner analyzes scenarios
- **Practical Demonstration** - Learner demonstrates skills (e.g., hand washing, moving & handling)
- **Written Assignment** - In-depth knowledge assessment

### 3. Assessment Criteria Mapping
- Each activity mapped to specific learning outcomes
- Clear demonstration of how criteria will be met
- Multiple evidence types for robust assessment
- Quality assurance through IQA sampling

**Example (Unit 1 - Duty of Care):**
