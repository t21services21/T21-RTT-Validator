# üö® **WHY YOU'RE STILL SEEING BAD QUESTIONS**

## **THE PROBLEM:**

You're seeing nonsense questions like:
- ‚ùå "What experience do you have working with **vision**?"
- ‚ùå "What experience do you have working with **judgement to**?"
- ‚ùå "What experience do you have working with **their knowledge**?"

**This means GPT-4 is NOT being used!**

---

## **ROOT CAUSE:**

**OpenAI API Key is NOT configured in your Streamlit app!**

Without the API key:
- ‚ùå GPT-4 cannot be called
- ‚ùå System falls back to broken keyword matching
- ‚ùå You get random word extraction ("vision", "judgement to", etc.)
- ‚ùå Questions are nonsense

---

## **‚úÖ HOW TO FIX (5 MINUTES):**

### **Step 1: Get OpenAI API Key**

1. Go to: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. Sign in (or create account)
3. Click "Create new secret key"
4. Copy the key (starts with `sk-proj-...`)

**Cost:** ~¬£5-10/month for typical usage

---

### **Step 2: Add to Streamlit Cloud**

1. Go to: https://streamlit.io/cloud
2. Click on your app
3. Click **Settings** (‚öôÔ∏è icon)
4. Click **Secrets** tab
5. Add this EXACT line:

```toml
OPENAI_API_KEY = "sk-proj-your-actual-key-here"
```

6. Click **Save**
7. App will restart automatically

---

### **Step 3: Test**

1. Refresh your app
2. Go to Interview Prep
3. Upload job description
4. You should see: **"ü§ñ Using GPT-4 AI to analyze your job description..."**

---

## **WHAT WILL CHANGE:**

### **BEFORE (Current - No API Key):**

‚ùå **Nonsense Questions:**
- "What experience with vision?"
- "What experience with judgement to?"
- Random word extraction

‚ùå **Generic Questions:**
- 10-15 basic questions
- Not job-specific
- Bland answers

‚ùå **No Organization Research:**
- No mission/vision
- No values
- No specifics

---

### **AFTER (With API Key & GPT-4):**

‚úÖ **Intelligent Questions (30-40):**
- "What experience do you have with **audio typing clinic letters** using **digital dictation systems**?"
- "How would you manage a **consultant's diary** across **multiple sites**?"
- "What's your experience with **medical terminology** in **cardiology**?"

‚úÖ **Expert-Level Answers:**
- 300-500 words each
- Job-specific examples
- Metrics and specifics
- STAR method

‚úÖ **Complete Preparation:**
- Organization research (mission, vision, values)
- Interview etiquette guide
- 10-12 smart questions to ask them
- Post-interview strategy
- Salary discussion guide

‚úÖ **Better Than ChatGPT Premium:**
- Senior NHS HR Specialist persona
- Industry insider knowledge
- Red flags to avoid
- What panels actually look for

---

## **WHY IT'S NOT WORKING NOW:**

When you refresh your app, you should see this warning:

```
‚ö†Ô∏è OpenAI API Key Not Configured

The system is using a basic keyword-matching fallback method instead of AI.

To enable GPT-4 AI (MUCH better results):
1. Go to Streamlit Cloud Dashboard
2. Click your app ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Secrets
3. Add this line:
   OPENAI_API_KEY = "sk-your-key-here"
4. Save and restart app

Without GPT-4: You'll get basic questions (like you're seeing now)
With GPT-4: 30-40 expert questions tailored to the job description
```

**This warning tells you EXACTLY what's wrong and how to fix it!**

---

## **CODE CHANGES MADE:**

### **1. Added Visible Warnings**

**File:** `interview_prep.py`

**What it does:**
- Shows clear message if no API key found
- Shows "ü§ñ Using GPT-4..." when it works
- Shows errors if GPT-4 fails
- Tells user HOW to fix it

**Before:**
- Silent failure
- No indication why questions are bad
- User confused

**After:**
- Clear warning message
- Step-by-step instructions
- User knows exactly what to do

---

### **2. Better Error Handling**

```python
if OPENAI_AVAILABLE:
    try:
        api_key = st.secrets.get("OPENAI_API_KEY")
        if api_key:
            st.info("ü§ñ Using GPT-4 AI to analyze your job description...")
            return analyze_with_gpt4(...)
        else:
            st.warning("""
            ‚ö†Ô∏è OpenAI API Key Not Configured
            
            [Clear instructions how to fix]
            """)
    except Exception as e:
        st.error(f"‚ùå GPT-4 analysis error: {e}")
```
