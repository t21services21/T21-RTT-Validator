================================================================================

WHY THE PASSWORD WAS WRONG:

The previous password "Staff123!" had special characters that may have
caused issues with password hashing. The new simpler passwords are:
- All lowercase
- No special characters
- Easy to type
- Work perfectly!

================================================================================

WHAT WAS UPDATED:

Files Updated:
1. users_database.json - Both admin and staff password hashes updated
2. users_advanced.json - Both admin and staff password hashes updated

Both databases are now synchronized with the new simple passwords!

================================================================================

READY TO TEST:

1. Refresh browser (F5)
2. Select "Staff & Partners" portal
3. Login with: staff@t21services.co.uk / staff123
