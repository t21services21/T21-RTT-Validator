# üîç COMPLETE RTT VALIDATION PROCESS - Every Single Step

**Date:** October 14, 2025  
**Purpose:** Document EVERY validation step from start to finish  
**Critical:** Code 11 RESTARTS clock previously stopped by 31/32/91

---

## üéØ CRITICAL CORRECTION: CODE 11

### Code 11 - Clock RESTART (Not just start!)
- **Code 11** = FIRST ACTIVITY AFTER WATCHFUL WAIT ENDS
- **Restarts clock** that was previously stopped by:
  - Code 31 (Patient watchful wait)
  - Code 32 (Clinician watchful wait)
  - Code 91 (Activity during watchful wait)
- **NOT a new clock** - it's a continuation!

**Example:**
```
Step 1: Code 10 (Clock starts) - Referral received
Step 2: Code 20 (Clock ticking) - First appointment
Step 3: Code 31 (Clock STOPS) - Patient chooses watchful wait
        [Clock paused - patient monitoring condition]
Step 4: Code 11 (Clock RESTARTS) - Patient ready for treatment
Step 5: Code 20 (Clock ticking) - Further appointments
Step 6: Code 30 (Clock STOPS) - Treatment given

Total waiting time = (Step 3 date - Step 1 date) + (Step 6 date - Step 4 date)
Excludes the watchful wait period!
```

Code 20 (15/05/2025) - Appointment
Code 30 (30/05/2025) - Treatment (Clock STOPS)
```

**Calculation:**
```
Period 1: 30/01/2025 - 01/01/2025 = 29 days
Period 2: 30/05/2025 - 30/04/2025 = 30 days
Total Waiting Time = 29 + 30 = 59 days = 8.4 weeks
