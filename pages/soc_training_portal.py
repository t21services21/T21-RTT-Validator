            ### What is Cybersecurity?
            
            Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. 
            These cyberattacks are usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information, 
            extorting money from users, or interrupting normal business processes.
            
            ### The CIA Triad
            
            The foundation of cybersecurity is built on three core principles:
            
            **1. Confidentiality**
            - Ensures that information is only accessible to authorized individuals
            - Examples: Encryption, access controls, authentication
            - Real-world: Password protection, data encryption
            
            **2. Integrity**
            - Ensures that information is accurate and hasn't been tampered with
            - Examples: Checksums, digital signatures, version control
            - Real-world: File integrity monitoring, blockchain
            
            **3. Availability**
            - Ensures that information and resources are accessible when needed
            - Examples: Redundancy, backups, DDoS protection
            - Real-world: Load balancing, disaster recovery
            
            ### Common Threats
            
            **Malware:** Malicious software designed to harm or exploit systems
            - Viruses, worms, trojans, ransomware, spyware
            
            **Phishing:** Social engineering attacks to steal credentials
            - Email phishing, spear phishing, whaling
            
            **DDoS Attacks:** Overwhelming systems with traffic
            - Volumetric, protocol, application layer attacks
            
            **Insider Threats:** Threats from within the organization
            - Malicious insiders, negligent employees
            
            ### Defense in Depth
            
            Multiple layers of security controls:
            1. Physical security
            2. Network security
            3. Endpoint security
            4. Application security
            5. Data security
            6. User education
            
            ### Key Takeaways
            
            ✅ Cybersecurity protects against digital threats
            ✅ CIA Triad is the foundation (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability)
            ✅ Multiple threat types require multiple defenses
            ✅ Defense in depth provides layered protection

            - Internet Layer (IP, ICMP)
            - Network Access Layer (Ethernet, Wi-Fi)
            
            ### Common Ports
            
            | Port | Protocol | Use |
            |------|----------|-----|
            | 21   | FTP      | File Transfer |
            | 22   | SSH      | Secure Shell |
            | 23   | Telnet   | Remote Access (Insecure) |
            | 25   | SMTP     | Email |

            - Allow/Deny traffic based on:
              - Source IP
              - Destination IP
              - Port numbers
              - Protocols
            
            ### IDS vs IPS

            - Active prevention
            - Can stop attacks in real-time
            
            ### VPNs
            
            **Purpose:**
            - Secure remote access
            - Encrypt traffic
            - Hide IP addresses

            - Remote access VPN
            - SSL/TLS VPN
            
            ### Network Segmentation
            
            **Why segment?**
            - Limit attack spread
            - Improve performance
            - Easier management
            - Compliance requirements

            ### Incident Response Lifecycle
            
            The NIST Incident Response framework consists of four main phases:
            
            **1. Preparation**
            - Develop IR plan
            - Train IR team
            - Deploy tools
            - Create playbooks
            - Establish communication channels
            
            **2. Detection & Analysis**
            - Monitor alerts
            - Identify incidents
            - Determine scope
            - Assess severity
            - Document findings
            
            **3. Containment, Eradication & Recovery**
            - Contain the threat
            - Remove malware
            - Patch vulnerabilities
            - Restore systems
            - Verify recovery
            
            **4. Post-Incident Activity**
            - Lessons learned
            - Update procedures
            - Improve defenses
            - Report to stakeholders
            
            ### Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)
            
            **Network IOCs:**
            - Suspicious IP addresses
            - Malicious domains
            - Unusual ports

            A SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) is a comprehensive security solution that:
            
            1. **Collects** security data from multiple sources (firewalls, servers, endpoints)
            2. **Aggregates** and normalizes the data
            3. **Analyzes** events in real-time
            4. **Correlates** events to detect threats
            5. **Alerts** security teams about incidents
            6. **Stores** logs for compliance and investigation
            
            Popular SIEM tools include Splunk, IBM QRadar, and Microsoft Sentinel.
