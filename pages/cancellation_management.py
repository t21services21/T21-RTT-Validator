    ### Why Cancellations Matter for RTT
    
    **Who cancelled the appointment determines the RTT clock impact!**
    
    ### 🚨 CRITICAL RTT RULES:
    
    #### 1️⃣ **PATIENT CANCELLED** (Patient's responsibility)
    - ✅ **RTT Clock:** CONTINUES running
    - 📅 **Action:** Offer new appointment
    - ⏱️ **Impact:** Patient still counts toward 18-week target
    - 📝 **Documentation:** Record reason and re-book date
    
    #### 2️⃣ **HOSPITAL CANCELLED** (Trust's responsibility)
    - 🔄 **RTT Clock:** ADJUSTED - Clock "pauses" from cancelled date
    - 📅 **Action:** Offer appointment within reasonable time
    - ⚠️ **Impact:** Trust MUST offer alternative within 18 weeks from original referral
    - 📊 **Reporting:** Counts as hospital cancellation in performance data
    
    #### 3️⃣ **CLINICAL REASON** (Medical necessity)
    - 🏥 **RTT Clock:** Depends on reason
    - 📅 **Action:** Clinical review required
    - ⚕️ **Examples:**
      - Patient unwell → Clock continues
      - Consultant unavailable → Clock adjusts
      - Emergency surgery priority → Clock adjusts
    
    ### 📊 Impact on NHS Performance
    
    **Hospital Cancellations:**
    - Reported to NHS England monthly
    - Affects trust's performance rating
    - May trigger CQC investigation if excessive
    - Financial penalties possible
    
    **Patient Cancellations:**
    - Less severe but still monitored
    - May indicate patient engagement issues
    - Could signal safeguarding concerns
    
    ### ⏰ Late Cancellations
    
    **<6 weeks notice:**
    - Difficult to fill slot
    - Wasted capacity
    - Lost income
    
    **Last-minute (<24 hours):**
    - Almost impossible to fill
    - Maximum waste
    - May count as DNA if no-show
