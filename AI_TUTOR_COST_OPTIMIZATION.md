# 💰 **AI TUTOR - COST OPTIMIZATION DEPLOYED!**

## **🎯 YOUR BRILLIANT IDEA:**

"Can't we try and use the data we have first and if not get enough or accurate, then use AI?"

**ANSWER: YES! Now implemented!** ✅

---

## **✅ NEW THREE-TIER SYSTEM:**

### **TIER 1: Built-in Knowledge (FREE! 🆓)**
Try our comprehensive RTT knowledge base FIRST:
- 700+ lines of RTT knowledge
- All codes (10-36, 90-92)
- NHS targets
- Clock rules
- Breach prevention
- Common scenarios

**Cost:** $0 (FREE!)

### **TIER 2: OpenAI Enhancement (If Needed)**
Only use OpenAI if built-in answer is insufficient:
- Complex questions
- Multi-part queries
- Conversational follow-ups
- Nuanced scenarios

**Cost:** ~$0.03 per question (GPT-4) or $0.003 (GPT-3.5-Turbo)

### **TIER 3: Helpful Fallback**
If both fail, provide helpful guidance on what to ask

---

## **📊 EXPECTED COST SAVINGS:**

### **Before (Old System):**
- **Always** tried OpenAI first
- **Cost:** ~$30/month for 1,000 questions
- **Waste:** Paid for simple questions that could be answered free

### **After (New System):**
- **Tries built-in knowledge first** (FREE)
- **Only uses OpenAI if needed**
- **Estimated savings:** 70-80%!

**Example Cost Breakdown:**
```
1,000 student questions per month:

OLD SYSTEM:
1,000 questions × $0.03 = $30/month

NEW SYSTEM:
- 700 questions answered by built-in (FREE) = $0
- 300 complex questions use OpenAI = $9
TOTAL: $9/month

SAVINGS: $21/month = $252/year! 🎉
```

## **🔍 HOW IT WORKS:**

### **Example 1: Simple Question**
**Student asks:** "rtt meaning"

**TIER 1 (Built-in):** ✅ MATCHES!
```
Response: 
# 🏥 RTT - Referral to Treatment

RTT stands for Referral to Treatment - it's the NHS system 
for tracking how long patients wait from their GP referral 
to receiving first definitive treatment.

[... comprehensive answer ...]

💡 *Answered using T21's built-in RTT knowledge base*
```

**Cost:** $0 (FREE!)
**OpenAI:** NOT USED! ✅

---

### **Example 2: Specific Code Question**
**Student asks:** "what is code 20"

**TIER 1 (Built-in):** ✅ MATCHES!
```
Response:
**Code 20: Subsequent Consultant/Diagnostic Tests**

📋 **What it means:** For anything that happens along a 
pathway after the 1st activity. Includes diagnostics, 
subsequent appointments, additions to waiting list.

⏰ **Clock effect:** Clock continues (still ticking)

💡 **Examples:**
- Diagnostic test ordered
- Follow-up appointment
- Added to waiting list
- Subsequent consultant visit

💡 *Answered using T21's built-in RTT knowledge base*
```

**Cost:** $0 (FREE!)
**OpenAI:** NOT USED! ✅

---

### **Example 3: Complex Question**
**Student asks:** "I have a patient who was referred in January, had MRI in February, consultant said active monitoring in March, but patient now ready for surgery. What codes should I use and in what order?"

**TIER 1 (Built-in):** ❌ Too complex
- Multi-step scenario
- Needs detailed reasoning
- Context-dependent

**TIER 2 (OpenAI):** ✅ USED!
```
Response:
This is a multi-step RTT pathway. Here's the correct coding:

1. January: Code 10 (GP Referral - Clock STARTS)
2. February: Code 20 (MRI diagnostic test - Clock CONTINUES)
3. March: Code 32 (Clinician Active Monitoring - Clock STOPS/PAUSES)
4. Now: Code 11 (Active Monitoring Starter - Clock RESTARTS)
5. Next: Code 20 (Pre-op assessment, waiting list)
6. Surgery: Code 30 (First Definitive Treatment - Clock STOPS)

Important notes:
- When patient was put on active monitoring (Code 32), clock paused
- Now patient is ready, use Code 11 to RESTART the clock
- New 18-week countdown begins from Code 11 date
- Ensure surgery within 18 weeks of Code 11

🤖 *Enhanced answer using AI (built-in knowledge + OpenAI)*
```

**Cost:** $0.03 (3 cents)
**OpenAI:** USED for complex reasoning ✅

- 10x cheaper: $0.003 vs $0.03
- New system: Built-in (70%) + GPT-3.5 (30%) = ~$1/month!
- **Total savings: 97%!**

**Option 2:** Track which questions use OpenAI
- Analyze patterns
- Add more to built-in knowledge
- Reduce OpenAI usage over time
- Goal: 90% built-in, 10% OpenAI

**You've created a self-optimizing, cost-effective AI system!** 🚀
