# CAREER TOOLS NOW OPTIONAL

Date: October 25, 2025 12:13 PM
Issue: CV Builder and Career Development were automatic
Status: FIXED - Now optional only

---

## ‚úÖ **WHAT I FIXED:**

### **Problem:**
When assigning Level 3 students, the system automatically gave:
- Learning Portal (needed)
- Career Development (should be optional!) ‚ùå
- CV Builder (should be optional!) ‚ùå
- Help & Information (needed)

### **Solution:**
Removed Career Development and CV Builder from automatic assignment.

## üéØ **NEW BEHAVIOR:**

### **Level 3 Adult Care Student:**

**Automatic (Always given):**
- ‚úÖ Learning Portal
- ‚úÖ Help & Information

**Optional (You choose):**
- ‚òê Career Development (tick if you want)
- ‚òê CV Builder (tick if you want)
- ‚òê Job Interview Prep (tick if you want)
