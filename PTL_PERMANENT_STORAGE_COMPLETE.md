# ✅ PTL PERMANENT STORAGE - COMPLETE!

**Date:** 2025-10-10  
**Status:** READY TO DEPLOY  

---

## 🎉 WHAT WE JUST BUILT

**PERMANENT per-student storage for PTL System!**

### Before:
❌ Data lost on logout  
❌ No progress tracking  
❌ Session-only storage  

### After:
✅ **PERMANENT database storage**  
✅ **Each student sees ONLY their data**  
✅ **Available every time they login**  
✅ **Build portfolio over time**  
✅ **Track progress across sessions**  

---

## 📊 HOW IT WORKS

### When Student Adds Patient:
1. Student fills PTL form
2. System saves to Supabase with **their email**
3. Saved permanently in database
4. Available forever

### When Student Views PTL:
1. Student opens PTL
2. System queries: `WHERE user_email = their_email`
3. Shows ONLY their patients
4. Never sees other students' data

### Security (Row Level Security):
```sql
-- Students can ONLY see their own data
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own PTL data"
    ON ptl_patients FOR SELECT
    USING (auth.email() = user_email);
```

---

## 📁 FILES MODIFIED (3)

### 1. `supabase_database.py`
**Added PTL functions:**
- `add_ptl_patient(user_email, patient_data)`
- `get_ptl_patients_for_user(user_email)`
- `get_ptl_patient_by_id(patient_id, user_email)`
- `update_ptl_patient(patient_id, user_email, updates)`
- `delete_ptl_patient(patient_id, user_email)`
- `get_ptl_stats_for_user(user_email)`

### 2. `ptl_system.py`
**Modified to use Supabase:**
- `load_ptl()` → Now loads from Supabase per user
- `add_patient_to_ptl()` → Saves to Supabase with user_email
- All functions filter by logged-in user

### 3. `ptl_ui.py`
**Updated UI message:**
- Changed from "session storage" warning
- Now shows "PERMANENT STORAGE ENABLED!"
- Explains benefits to students

### 4. `CREATE_PTL_TABLE.sql` (NEW)
**Database schema for Supabase:**
- Creates `ptl_patients` table
- Adds indexes for performance
- Sets up Row Level Security (RLS)
- Each row tagged with user_email

## 🚀 DEPLOYMENT STEPS

### **Step 1: Create Database Table in Supabase** ⚠️ REQUIRED

1. Login to Supabase: https://supabase.com
2. Go to **SQL Editor**
3. Open file: `CREATE_PTL_TABLE.sql`
4. **Copy ALL the SQL**
5. **Paste into Supabase SQL Editor**
6. Click **RUN**
7. ✅ Table created with RLS policies!

### **Step 2: Push Code to GitHub**

```bash
# Commit message:
"Add permanent per-student storage for PTL system using Supabase"
```

**Files to push:**
- `supabase_database.py` (modified)
- `ptl_system.py` (modified)
- `ptl_ui.py` (modified)
- `CREATE_PTL_TABLE.sql` (new)
- `PTL_PERMANENT_STORAGE_COMPLETE.md` (new - this file)

### **Step 3: Wait for Deployment**
- Streamlit Cloud rebuilds (2-3 minutes)
- New code deploys automatically

### **Step 4: Test It!**

1. Login to platform
2. Go to PTL System
3. Add a patient
4. **Logout**
5. **Login again**
6. Go back to PTL
7. ✅ **Patient still there!** 🎉

## 📈 DATABASE SCHEMA

### `ptl_patients` Table:
```
Column              Type            Purpose
-------------------------------------------------
id                  SERIAL          Primary key
patient_id          VARCHAR(50)     Unique PTL ID
user_email          VARCHAR(255)    Which student owns this
patient_name        VARCHAR(255)    Patient name
nhs_number          VARCHAR(20)     NHS number
specialty           VARCHAR(100)    Medical specialty

## 🐛 TROUBLESHOOTING

### "No patients showing":
1. Check Supabase table exists
2. Verify RLS policies created
3. Check user is logged in
4. Confirm user_email in session

### "Permission denied":
1. RLS policies might not be set
2. Run CREATE_PTL_TABLE.sql again
3. Check Supabase logs

### "Supabase not available":
1. Check Streamlit secrets configured
2. Verify SUPABASE_URL and SUPABASE_KEY
3. System will fallback to session storage
