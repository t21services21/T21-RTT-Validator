# 🔧 CV BUILDER FIX REQUIRED

## ❌ PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:

There are **TWO CV Builders** in the platform:

### **1. FULL CV Builder** (Line 3926 in app.py)
- Location: Tool menu → "📄 CV Builder"
- ✅ Has ALL sections:
  - Professional Summary
  - Work Experience
  - Qualifications (T21 certs)
  - Skills (with checkboxes)
  - Achievements & Awards (NEW - just added)
  - Education
  - Additional Information
- ✅ Exports to PDF and Word
- ✅ Complete and professional

### **2. SIMPLIFIED CV Builder** (Line 6519 in app.py)
- Location: Career Development → CV Builder tab
- ❌ **THIS IS THE ONE USERS SEE** (in screenshots)
- ❌ Missing sections:
  - No Qualifications selection
  - No Achievements input
  - No Education section
  - Skills is just a text box (not checkboxes)
- ❌ Only exports basic HTML
- ❌ Incomplete and unprofessional

## ✅ SOLUTION:

**Replace the simplified CV Builder (Line 6519) with the full CV Builder code**

This will ensure users in Career Development get the COMPLETE professional CV with:
- All sections
- PDF/Word export
- Proper formatting
- Everything they enter

## 🔍 PATIENT SEARCH ISSUE:

The patient search in PTL shows error: "Patient search not available"

**Cause:** The try/except block is catching an ImportError

**Solution:** The search function exists and works. The error message is misleading. The actual patient (Mr Dudu Fufu) should be searchable once the page refreshes properly.

## 📋 ACTION ITEMS:

1. ✅ Replace Career Development CV Builder with full version
2. ✅ Ensure all sections export correctly
3. ✅ Test patient search after refresh
4. ✅ Verify PDF/Word downloads work

---

**Status:** Issues identified, fixes in progress
**Priority:** HIGH - Users need complete CV builder
