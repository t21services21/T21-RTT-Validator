- Exam Management ❌ (students saw this!)
- AI Document Training ❌ (students saw this!)

## **📋 CODE CHANGES:**

### **File 1: `app.py` - Module List (Lines 1543-1555)**

**ADDED for students:**
```python
"🏥 Patient Administration Hub",  # PRACTICE: Register patients, pathways, waiting lists
"🏥 Clinical Workflows",  # PRACTICE: PTL, booking, MDT workflows
```

```python
"⚙️ Administration"  →  "⚙️ My Account"  # Clear naming
```

### **File 2: `app.py` - Administration Handler (Lines 6545-6731)**

**ADDED role detection:**
```python
# SECURITY: Students see only "My Account", Admins see all tools
user_role = st.session_state.user_license.role
is_student = user_role in ['student', 'student_basic', ...]

if is_student:
    # STUDENTS: Only My Account
    tabs = st.tabs(["⚙️ My Account"])
else:
    # ADMINS: Full administration tools
    tabs = st.tabs([
        "⚙️ My Account", 
        "🔧 Admin Panel", 
        "📊 Learning Analytics",
        ...
    ])

# Only render admin tabs if NOT student
if not is_student and len(tabs) > 1:
    with tabs[1]:
        # Admin Panel
    with tabs[2]:
        # Learning Analytics
    ...
```
