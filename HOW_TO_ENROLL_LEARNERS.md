## PASSWORDS - HOW IT WORKS:

### IMPORTANT:
Passwords are NOT automatically sent in enrollment emails (security best practice)

### HOW LEARNERS GET PASSWORDS:

**OPTION 1: Learner Already Has Account**
- If learner already registered on platform
- They use their existing password
- Enrollment email tells them to login
- No password needed from you

**OPTION 2: You Create Account First (RECOMMENDED)**

Step 1: Create learner account
- Go to Teaching & Assessment
- Click "Student Management" tab
- Add new student
- Set or generate password
- Save account

Step 2: Send password separately
- Email or text password to learner
- Keep it secure (don't put in enrollment email)

Step 3: Enroll in course
- Go to "TQUK Course Assignment" tab
- Select learner
- Select course
- Click "Assign Course"
- Enrollment email sent automatically

**OPTION 3: Learner Self-Registers**
- Learner goes to platform
