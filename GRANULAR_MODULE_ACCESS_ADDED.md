# GRANULAR MODULE ACCESS FOR STUDENT REGISTRATION

Date: October 25, 2025 1:09 AM
Issue: No way to select specific modules for Level 3 students
Status: FIXED - Added 3 access options

---

## THE PROBLEM:

When registering students, you only had 2 options:

1. ❌ **UNCHECK "Grant access to ALL modules"** = Student gets almost nothing
2. ✅ **CHECK "Grant access to ALL modules"** = Student gets EVERYTHING (43 modules!)

**No way to give Level 3 students ONLY the modules they need!**

---

## THE FIX:

### **NEW: 3 Module Access Options**

When registering a student, you now choose from:

**1. 🎓 Level 3 Student (Recommended)**
- Perfect for TQUK Level 3 learners
- Grants access to:
  - 🎓 Learning Portal

  - 📄 CV Builder
  - ℹ️ Help & Information

  - Teaching tools
  - Other TQUK courses

**2. 🔓 Grant ALL modules**
- For staff, teachers, assessors
- Grants all 43 modules
- Full platform access

**3. 🎯 Select Specific Modules**
