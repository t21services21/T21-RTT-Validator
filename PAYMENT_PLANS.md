### **Installment Plans - LEGALLY BINDING:**

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Installment plans are LEGALLY BINDING CONTRACTS**

When you choose an installment plan, you are entering into a legal contract to pay ALL installments, even if you:
- Complete the program early
- No longer want to continue
- Change your mind
- Move out of the country

**You MUST pay ALL installments to:**
- Receive your TQUK certificate (Tier 2 & 3)

- Access job placement services (Tier 3)

**Payment Structure:**
- **First payment: 50%+ upfront** (covers our costs)
- **Subsequent payments:** Spread over time
- **Auto-debit required:** Credit/debit card kept on file
- **Legally enforceable:** We can pursue legal action for non-payment

**Failed Payments:**
- **1 missed payment:** 7-day grace period, warning email
- **2nd missed payment:** Account suspended immediately
- **3rd missed payment:** 
  - Sent to collections agency
  - Legal action initiated
  - Certificate permanently withheld
  - Access terminated

**Certificate Release:**
- **Tier 2 & 3:** Certificate ONLY issued after FINAL payment received
- Even if you pass exam in week 8, certificate held until month 5-7 (depending on plan)
- No exceptions - this prevents payment gaming

### **Refunds:**
- **Taster:** 48-hour money-back guarantee
- **Tier 1:** 7-day money-back guarantee (from first payment)
- **Tier 2 & 3:** 7-day cooling-off period from FIRST payment only
