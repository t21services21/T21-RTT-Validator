---

## üìä **COMPETITIVE POSITIONING**

### **What We Can Say Truthfully:**

‚úÖ "Only platform with AI-powered PTL"
‚úÖ "Only solution combining RTT training + AI tools"
‚úÖ "Most comprehensive RTT & pathway training"
‚úÖ "AI validation 120x faster than manual"
‚úÖ "Complete pathway coordinator certification"

### **What We CANNOT Say (Yet):**

‚ùå "Train for ALL NHS admin roles" (only 8 of 15)
‚ùå "Complete cancer pathway suite" (building)
‚ùå "Full MDT coordination" (not yet)
‚ùå "Every NHS administrative function" (not true)

---

## ‚úÖ **FINAL HONEST ASSESSMENT**

**Question: "Do we have all modules and AI support for all 15+ roles?"**

**Answer: NO - We have 8 roles solidly, 5 more need building**

**But that's OK because:**
1. The 8 we have are the MOST IN-DEMAND roles
2. RTT/Pathway is the BIGGEST pain point for NHS
3. Our 8 roles are better than anyone else's 15 basic ones
4. We can build the rest in 6 months
5. We should market what we HAVE, not what we WILL have

**Recommendation:**
- **Market:** 8 roles we can deliver TODAY
- **Mention:** More roles coming (roadmap)
- **Build:** Missing roles over next 6 months
- **Deliver:** Excellence in what we promise

**Better to OVER-DELIVER on 8 roles than UNDER-DELIVER on 15!**

---

**This is the honest truth. What do you want to do?**

1. **Option A:** Market only the 8 roles we can fully deliver ‚≠ê
2. **Option B:** Build cancer modules first (1 month), then market 12 roles
3. **Option C:** Promise all 15 roles but mark some "coming soon"

**I recommend Option A - be honest, deliver excellence, build trust!** ‚ú®
