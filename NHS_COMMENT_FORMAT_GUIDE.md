```

---

## üîÑ **Logic Flow:**

### **1. Determine Clock Status:**
- **Codes 30-36** = Clock STOPS ‚Üí Use `CS [DATE] ([CODE])` format
- **All other codes** = Clock CONTINUES ‚Üí Standard format

### **2. Extract Letter Date:**
- System scans letter for date patterns
- Looks for: "Date:", "Dated:", or any DD/MM/YYYY format
- Falls back to validation date if not found

### **3. Identify Actions from Letter:**
- Treatment completed ‚Üí "MEDICATION PRESCRIBED/TREATMENT COMPLETED"
- Discharge ‚Üí "DISCHARGED NO TREATMENT REQUIRED"
- Waiting list ‚Üí "PATIENT ADDED TO WAITING LIST"
- Referral ‚Üí "REFERRAL RECEIVED. RTT CLOCK STARTED"

### **4. Check PAS vs Letter:**
- If letter says "follow-up in 6 weeks"
  - PAS shows booked ‚Üí "F/U APPT BOOKED FOR [DATE]"
  - PAS shows not booked ‚Üí "F/U APPT REQUIRED BOOKING"

### **5. Generate Final Comment:**
```
Combine: Clock Status + Date + Code + Initials + Letter Reference + Actions + F/U Status
```

## üìä **Real-World Examples:**

### **Example 1: Treatment Letter with Booked Follow-up**

**Letter:**
```
Date: 24/05/2025
Dear Patient,
You were treated with antibiotics for infection on 23/04/2025.
Please attend follow-up on 05/07/2025 to review progress.
```

**PAS:**
- Follow-up booked: Y
- Follow-up date: 05/07/2025

**Comment:**
```
CS 23/04/2025 (30) JDS AS PER CL DATED 24/05/2025 MEDICATION PRESCRIBED/TREATMENT COMPLETED. F/U APPT BOOKED FOR 05/07/2025
```

---

### **Example 2: Treatment Letter WITHOUT Follow-up Booked**

**Letter:**
```
Date: 24/05/2025

Treatment completed on 23/04/2025. Follow-up required in 6 weeks.
```

**PAS:**
- Follow-up booked: N

**Comment:**
```
CS 23/04/2025 (30) JDS AS PER CL DATED 24/05/2025 MEDICATION PRESCRIBED/TREATMENT COMPLETED. F/U APPT REQUIRED BOOKING
```

---

### **Example 3: Discharge with No Follow-up**

**Letter:**
```
Date: 16/09/2025
Results normal. No further treatment required. Discharged to GP care.
```

**Comment:**
```
CS 16/09/2025 (34) IE AS PER CL DATED 16/09/2025 DISCHARGED NO TREATMENT REQUIRED
```

---

### **Example 4: Decision to Treat - Patient on WL**

**Letter:**
```
Date: 16/09/2025
Decision made to list patient for knee arthroscopy.
Patient added to surgical waiting list today.
```

**PAS:**
- Waiting list: Y

**Validation Date:** 08/10/2025

**Comment:**
```
08/10/2025 CO DECISION TO TREAT MADE. PATIENT ADDED TO WAITING LIST
```

---

### **Example 5: Decision to Treat - NOT on WL Yet**

**Letter:**
```

Decision made to list patient for surgery.
```

**PAS:**
- Waiting list: N

**Validation Date:** 08/10/2025

**Comment:**
```
08/10/2025 CO DECISION TO TREAT MADE. AWAITING WAITING LIST ENTRY
```

## ‚úÖ **Validation Workflow:**

1. **Read Letter** ‚Üí Extract:
   - Letter date
   - What happened (treatment/discharge/decision)
   - What's needed next (follow-up/WL/diagnostics)

2. **Check PAS** ‚Üí Verify:
   - Has letter action been completed?
   - Follow-up booked? (Y/N)
   - Waiting list entry? (Y/N)
   - Diagnostics ordered? (Y/N)

3. **Update PAS** ‚Üí Correct any mismatches:
   - If letter says "treatment on 23/04" but PAS blank ‚Üí UPDATE PAS
   - If letter says "F/U in 6 weeks" but not booked ‚Üí BOOK IT or FLAG

4. **Generate Comment** ‚Üí Reflects FINAL state:
   - After you've updated PAS
   - Comment shows what IS NOW in system
   - Not what WAS missing

---

## üéØ **Key Principle:**

**Comment = What you've VERIFIED and UPDATED in PAS**

**NOT** what was originally missing!

After validation:
- Letter says: Treatment on 23/04
- PAS was empty
- You UPDATE PAS: Treatment recorded, code 30 added, F/U booked
- Comment reflects COMPLETED state: `CS 23/04/2025 (30) JDS...`

---

## üìù **Quick Reference:**

| RTT Code | Clock Action | Comment Format |
|----------|--------------|----------------|
| 10 | START | `[VALIDATION_DATE] [INITIALS] REFERRAL RECEIVED...` |
| 20 | CONTINUE | `[VALIDATION_DATE] [INITIALS] [LETTER SUMMARY]...` |
| 30 | **STOP** | `CS [STOP_DATE] (30) [INITIALS] AS PER CL DATED [LETTER_DATE]...` |
| 31/32 | **PAUSE** | `AM (CODE XX) [INITIALS] AS PER CL DATED [LETTER_DATE]...` |
| 33 | CONTINUE/STOP | `DNA (33) [INITIALS] AS PER APPOINTMENT DATED [DATE]...` |
| 34 | **STOP** | `CS [STOP_DATE] (34) [INITIALS] AS PER CL DATED [LETTER_DATE]...` |
| 35 | **STOP** | `CS [STOP_DATE] (35) [INITIALS] AS PER CL DATED [LETTER_DATE]...` |

### **Key Difference:**
- **Clock STOPPED (30-36):** Use full format with `CS [DATE] ([CODE]) [INITIALS] AS PER CL DATED...`
- **Clock CONTINUES (10, 20, etc.):** Use simple format `[VALIDATION_DATE] [INITIALS] [SUMMARY]`
