# üìã PBL CHECK WORKFLOW - What Validators ACTUALLY Do

**Date:** October 18, 2025 at 4:15pm  
**Purpose:** Explain the REAL workflow when letter mentions waiting list

---

## **üì® THE SCENARIO:**

**Letter says:**
> "Patient will be offered an appointment when it becomes available"

**This means:**
- Referral is accepted ‚úÖ
- BUT no appointment slot available right now ‚ùå
- Patient should be on **Partial Booking List (PBL)** / **Outpatient Waiting List**

---

## **üìã WHAT IS PBL/OUTPATIENT WAITING LIST?**

**PBL = Partial Booking List**

This is the list of patients who:
- ‚úÖ Have been referred
- ‚úÖ Referral accepted
- ‚ùå DON'T have appointment yet
- ‚è∞ Waiting for first appointment to become available

**Also called:** Outpatient Waiting List, First Appointment Waiting List

---

## **üîç WHAT VALIDATORS MUST DO:**

### **Step 1: READ the Letter**
Letter says: "Patient to be added to waiting list / offered appointment when available"

### **Step 2: GO TO PBL System**
- Open PBL/Outpatient Waiting List system
- This is separate from main PAS

### **Step 3: SEARCH for Patient**
- Search by NHS number or patient name
- Look for this patient on the list

### **Step 4: CHECK - Is Patient on List?**

**Two Possible Outcomes:**

**‚úÖ OUTCOME A: Patient IS on PBL**
- Good! They're on the list
- They're waiting for appointment
- System is working correctly

**‚ùå OUTCOME B: Patient NOT on PBL**
- Problem! They should be on list but aren't
- Could be lost in system
- Need to escalate to booking team

### **Step 5: COMMENT What You FOUND**

**Your comment must reflect REALITY (what you found), NOT just repeat the letter!**

---

## **üí¨ COMMENTING BASED ON WHAT YOU FOUND:**

### **If Patient IS on PBL (Outcome A):**

```
18/10/2025 TSO, Referral received 01/10/2025, PT on PBL/outpatient waiting list, awaiting OPD appointment
```

**Breakdown:**
- `18/10/2025` = Today's date (when YOU validated)
- `TSO` = Your initials
- `Referral received 01/10/2025` = When referral received
- `PT on PBL/outpatient waiting list` = What you FOUND when you checked
- `awaiting OPD appointment` = Current status

---

### **If Patient NOT on PBL (Outcome B):**

```
18/10/2025 TSO, Referral received 01/10/2025, PT NOT on PBL - needs adding to PBL, first OPD requires booking
```

**Breakdown:**
- `18/10/2025` = Today's date (when YOU validated)
- `TSO` = Your initials
- `Referral received 01/10/2025` = When referral received
- `PT NOT on PBL` = What you FOUND (patient is missing from list!)
- `needs adding to PBL` = Action needed
- `first OPD requires booking` = What needs to happen

**THEN:** Escalate to booking team immediately!

---

## **üö® WHY THIS IS CRITICAL:**

### **If you DON'T check PBL:**

**Scenario:** Letter says "patient to be added to waiting list"

**What could happen:**
1. You assume patient is on PBL ‚ùå
2. You comment: "Patient to be added to PBL" (just repeating letter) ‚ùå
3. You don't actually CHECK if they're on PBL ‚ùå
4. **RESULT:** Patient is NOT on PBL, no one knows, patient lost in system for weeks/months! ‚ö†Ô∏è

### **If you DO check PBL:**

**What happens:**
1. You go to PBL system ‚úÖ
2. You search for patient ‚úÖ
3. You CHECK if they're on list ‚úÖ
4. You comment what you FOUND (reality) ‚úÖ
5. If NOT on PBL, you escalate ‚úÖ
6. **RESULT:** Patient is protected, won't be lost in system! ‚úÖ

## **üìä REAL EXAMPLE:**

### **Letter Content:**
```
Dear Consultant,

Thank you for accepting the referral for Mr John Smith (NHS: 123 456 7890).

The patient will be offered an appointment when one becomes available.

Regards,
Booking Team
```

### **What Validator Does:**

**Step 1:** Read letter ‚úÖ
- Referral accepted
- Patient should be on PBL

**Step 2:** Go to PBL system ‚úÖ

**Step 3:** Search for "John Smith" or "123 456 7890" ‚úÖ

**Step 4:** Check result

**SCENARIO A - Patient IS on PBL:**
```
‚úÖ FOUND: John Smith, NHS 123 456 7890
   Added to PBL: 01/10/2025
   Specialty: Cardiology
   Priority: Routine
   Status: Awaiting first appointment
```

**Comment:**
```
18/10/2025 TSO, Referral received 01/10/2025, PT on PBL/outpatient waiting list, awaiting OPD appointment
```

---

**SCENARIO B - Patient NOT on PBL:**
```
‚ùå NOT FOUND: No results for John Smith or NHS 123 456 7890
```

**Comment:**
```
18/10/2025 TSO, Referral received 01/10/2025, PT NOT on PBL - needs adding to PBL, first OPD requires booking
```

**Action:** Escalate to booking team immediately!

---

## **üéØ KEY POINTS:**

1. **PBL = Partial Booking List** = List of patients waiting for first appointment

2. **Always CHECK PBL** when letter mentions:
   - "Will be offered appointment when available"
   - "Added to waiting list"
   - "No appointment slots currently"
   - "Referral accepted, awaiting booking"

3. **Comment what you FIND**, not what letter says:
   - ‚úÖ "PT on PBL" = You checked, patient IS on list
   - ‚úÖ "PT NOT on PBL" = You checked, patient NOT on list
   - ‚ùå "PT to be added to PBL" = Just repeating letter (didn't check!)

4. **If NOT on PBL** ‚Üí Escalate immediately!
   - Patient could be lost in system
   - Could breach 18-week target
   - Impacts patient care
