## üé¨ FULL SCRIPT

### SCENE 1: INTRODUCTION (0:00-0:30)
**[Screen: Show T21 Logo with gold laurel wreath]**

**VOICEOVER:**
> "Hi, I'm [Your Name], founder of T21 Services Limited.
>
> Today, I want to show you something revolutionary in NHS healthcare administration.
>

### SCENE 2: PROBLEM STATEMENT (0:30-1:00)
**[Screen: Show statistics/graphics]**

**VOICEOVER:**
> "NHS trusts face three major challenges:
>
> **First:** Finding qualified RTT coordinators, cancer pathway specialists, and admin staff is nearly impossible. Traditional training takes 6-12 months.
>
> **Second:** Manual RTT validation is painfully slow. What takes a human 2 hours, our AI does in 60 seconds - 120 times faster.
>
> **Third:** Existing systems like Epic and Cerner cost ¬£10-40 million and don't focus on UK-specific NHS admin.
>
> We solved all three problems."

**[Screen: Show Before/After comparison graphics]**

### SCENE 3: SOLUTION OVERVIEW (1:00-1:30)

>
> Two: **Cancer Pathway Management** - 2WW and 62-day tracking
>
> Three: **MDT Coordination** - Meeting scheduling and outcome recording
>

>
> Six: **Data Quality & Governance** - Real-time validation
>
> Seven: **Professional Training Academy** - 188 hands-on scenarios for 15+ NHS roles
>
> Let me show you how it works."

**[Screen: Show landing page with 3 portals]**

**VOICEOVER:**

**[Screen: Show a quick scenario - maybe Scenario 1: Basic Clock Start]**

**VOICEOVER (continue):**
> "See how the AI tutor guides you through the process, asks questions, and provides instant feedback?
>
> This is completely self-paced. No tutor required. Available 24/7.
>
> Students go from zero experience to job-ready in 3-6 months. Our fastest student got hired in 8 weeks.
>
> For students, this costs ¬£299 to ¬£999 per year. Compare that to a ¬£5,000 college course."

**VOICEOVER (continue):**
> "I'm uploading a patient record. Watch how fast this works...
>
> **[Wait 2 seconds]**
>
> Done! In 60 seconds, the AI has:
> - Validated the clock start date
> - Predicted breach risk
> - Suggested corrective actions
> - Generated a priority score
>
> A human would take 2 hours to do this manually. We're 120 times faster.
>
> Now multiply that by 50,000 patients on your PTL. You can see why NHS trusts are saving ¬£2-3 million per year."

**[Screen: Show analytics dashboard with graphs]**
