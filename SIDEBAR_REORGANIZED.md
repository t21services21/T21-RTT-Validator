# SIDEBAR MODULES REORGANIZED BY WORKFLOW

Date: October 24, 2025 5:47 PM
Issue: Modules were mixed up, not grouped logically
Status: FIXED - Organized by workflow

---

## THE PROBLEM:

### Before:
Modules were in random order:
- Patient Admin Hub
- Learning Portal
- Teaching & Assessment
- TQUK Document Library
- Clinical Workflows
- Task Management
- AI & Automation
- Reports & Analytics
- Training & Certification
- Level 3 Adult Care
- IT User Skills
- Customer Service
- Business Administration
- Information Governance
- Career Development
- CV Builder
- Administration
- Help & Information
- Contact & Support

**Hard to navigate! Modules that are used together were separated!**

---

## THE FIX:

### After - Organized by Workflow Groups:

**GROUP 1: NHS/RTT WORKFLOW MODULES** (Used together)
1. 🏥 Patient Administration Hub
2. 🏥 Clinical Workflows
3. ✅ Task Management
4. 🤖 AI & Automation
5. 📊 Reports & Analytics

**GROUP 2: RTT TRAINING & CERTIFICATION** (PDLC-01-039)
6. 🎓 Learning Portal
7. 🎓 Training & Certification

**GROUP 3: TEACHING & ASSESSMENT**
8. 👨‍🏫 Teaching & Assessment
9. 📚 TQUK Document Library

**GROUP 4: TQUK QUALIFICATIONS** (Used together)
10. 📚 Level 3 Adult Care
11. 💻 IT User Skills
12. 🤝 Customer Service
13. 📊 Business Administration

**GROUP 5: PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT**
14. 🔒 Information Governance
15. 💼 Career Development
16. 📄 CV Builder

**GROUP 6: SYSTEM**
17. ⚙️ Administration
18. ℹ️ Help & Information
19. 📧 Contact & Support
