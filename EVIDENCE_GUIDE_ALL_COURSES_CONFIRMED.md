## 🔧 **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:**

### **Files Updated:**

1. **`tquk_evidence_requirements_guide.py`**
   - Added ALL 8 courses to `UNIT_CLASSIFICATIONS`
   - Updated `get_unit_evidence_summary()` to accept `course_id`
   - Updated `render_unit_specific_requirements()` to accept `course_id`

2. **`tquk_evidence_tracking.py`**
   - Updated to pass `course_id` to helper function
   - Shows course-specific requirements
   - Fallback to general guidance if error

### **Integration Points:**

All 6 main TQUK modules call:
```python
from tquk_evidence_tracking import render_evidence_submission_form

render_evidence_submission_form(learner_email, COURSE_ID, selected_unit)
```

Where `COURSE_ID` is:
- `"level3_adult_care"`
- `"level2_it_skills"`
- `"level2_customer_service"`
- `"level2_business_admin"`
- `"level2_adult_social_care"`
- `"level3_teaching_learning"`
