2. 🔨 Learning Materials (needs PDF download, Mark Complete, Go to Assessment)
3. 🔨 Assessments (needs interactive evidence submission form)
4. 🔨 Evidence Tracking (needs real tracking system)
5. 🔨 TQUK Documents (needs documents tab)
6. 🔨 My Progress (needs enhanced tracking)
7. 🔨 Certificate (needs dual certification display)
8. ✅ PAS Practice (exists, needs enhancement)

**Add Missing Functions:**
- `render_tquk_documents_tab()` - TQUK documents
- `render_certificate()` - Certificate display

### **2. Create Content File (CUSTOMER_SERVICE_ALL_UNITS_COMPLETE.md)**

**~300 pages of comprehensive content:**
- Unit 1: Customer Service Delivery (50+ pages)

- Unit 3: Understanding the Organization (40+ pages)
- Unit 4: Handling Customer Problems (50+ pages)

- Unit 6: Personal Development (50+ pages)

**Each unit needs:**

## 📊 **CURRENT STATUS:**

| Component | Status | Progress |
|-----------|--------|----------|

## 🎯 **NEXT STEPS:**

1. **Get TQUK specification** for Customer Service to verify:
   - Qualification number
   - Unit names and references
   - Credits and GLH
   
2. **Complete the module file** with:
   - All 8 tabs
   - Interactive assessments
   - Evidence tracking
   - TQUK documents
   - Certificate display

3. **Create comprehensive content** for all 6 units

4. **Test and verify** everything works

## 💡 **RECOMMENDATION:**

**Should I continue building Customer Service now, or:**
- Wait for TQUK specification to ensure accuracy?
- Focus on something else first?

**Customer Service is started but needs significant work to match the quality of the other three courses (Level 3 Adult Care, Level 2 Business Admin, Level 2 IT User Skills).**

Let me know if you want me to:
1. ✅ Continue building Customer Service (will take ~1 hour)
2. ✅ Get TQUK spec first, then build
3. ✅ Build something else instead
