# ✅ MESSAGES IN TQUK COURSES - VERIFICATION

## 🔍 **HOW TQUK COURSES WORK:**

### **Dynamic Module Loading:**

**For students with TQUK enrollments:**

```python
# 1. Get student's enrollments
enrollments = get_learner_enrollments(user_email)

# 2. Map course IDs to module names
course_to_module = {
    'level3_adult_care': '📚 Level 3 Adult Care',
    'level2_it_skills': '💻 IT User Skills',
    'level2_customer_service': '🤝 Customer Service',
    'level2_business_admin': '📊 Business Administration',
    'level2_adult_social_care': '🏥 Adult Social Care',
    'level3_teaching_learning': '👨‍🏫 Teaching & Learning',
    'functional_skills_english': '📚 Functional Skills English',
    'functional_skills_maths': '🔢 Functional Skills Maths'
}

# 3. Add enrolled courses to user modules
for enrollment in enrollments:
    course_id = enrollment.get('course_id', '')
    if course_id in course_to_module:
        module_name = course_to_module[course_id]
        user_modules.append(module_name)

# 4. ALWAYS include these basic modules
accessible_modules = [
    "💬 Messages",              # ✅ INCLUDED!
    "⚙️ My Account",
    "ℹ️ Help & Information",
    "📧 Contact & Support"
]

# 5. Combine: enrolled courses + basic modules
accessible_modules = user_modules + accessible_modules
```
