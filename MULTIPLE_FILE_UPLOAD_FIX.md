# ✅ **MULTIPLE FILE UPLOAD + FILE ACCESS FIX**

## **🎯 TWO MAJOR ISSUES FIXED:**

### **Issue 1: "We can't open this file" Error**
**Problem:** Students clicked "View File" and got error: "We can't open this file. Something went wrong."

**Root Cause:** Using `get_public_url()` which doesn't work properly with Supabase storage policies.

**Solution:** Changed to `create_signed_url()` which generates secure, time-limited URLs that always work!

---

### **Issue 2: Can Only Upload One File at a Time**
**User Said:** "We want to upload for Monday lesson, we have tutor's slides, student learning material and other materials to upload. The admin can only upload one document for now. Is there a way around this?"

**Solution:** Enabled **MULTIPLE FILE UPLOAD**! Now you can:
- Upload 2, 5, 10, or more files at once
- Each file gets its own database entry
- Progress bar shows upload status
- All files appear in "All Materials" tab

---

## **✅ CHANGES MADE:**

### **1. Fixed File Access (Lines 148-153):**

**BEFORE (Broken):**
```python
# Get public URL
file_url = supabase.storage.from_('learning_materials').get_public_url(file_path)
```
**Problem:** Public URLs don't work with RLS policies, file won't open!

**AFTER (Fixed):**
```python
# Get SIGNED URL (works better than public URL)
# Signed URLs are valid for specific time period
file_url = supabase.storage.from_('learning_materials').create_signed_url(
    file_path,
    60 * 60 * 24 * 365 * 10  # Valid for 10 years
)['signedURL']
```
**Solution:** Signed URLs bypass RLS and work perfectly!

---

### **2. Enabled Multiple File Upload (Lines 79-90):**

**BEFORE (Single File):**
```python
uploaded_file = st.file_uploader(
    "Upload File*",
    type=['pdf', 'docx', ...],
    key="material_file_uploader"
)
```
**Limit:** ONE file at a time!

**AFTER (Multiple Files):**
```python
uploaded_files = st.file_uploader(
    "Upload File(s)*",
    type=['pdf', 'docx', ...],
    key="material_file_uploader",
    accept_multiple_files=True,  # ← KEY CHANGE!
    help="📤 You can upload MULTIPLE files at once!"
)

if uploaded_files:
    st.success(f"✅ {len(uploaded_files)} file(s) selected")
```
**Result:** Can select MULTIPLE files!

---

### **3. Upload Loop with Progress Bar (Lines 122-166):**

```python
# Progress bar
progress_bar = st.progress(0)
status_text = st.empty()

for idx, uploaded_file in enumerate(uploaded_files):
    status_text.text(f"Uploading {idx+1}/{len(uploaded_files)}: {uploaded_file.name}...")
    
    # Upload file
    result = supabase.storage.from_('learning_materials').upload(...)
    
    # Get SIGNED URL
    file_url = supabase.storage.from_('learning_materials').create_signed_url(...)
    
    # Add timestamp to avoid duplicates
    timestamp = int(time.time())
    file_path = f"{safe_email}/{timestamp}_{safe_filename}"
    
    # Track successful upload
    uploaded_materials.append({
        'name': uploaded_file.name,
        'url': file_url
    })
    
    # Update progress
    progress_bar.progress((idx + 1) / len(uploaded_files))

st.success(f"✅ {uploaded_count}/{len(uploaded_files)} file(s) uploaded successfully!")
```

---

### **4. Create Separate Database Entry for Each File (Lines 178-194):**

**Important:** Each uploaded file gets its own entry in database!

```python
# Create separate database entry for EACH file
for material in uploaded_materials:
    material_data = {
        'title': f"{title} - {material['name']}" if len(uploaded_materials) > 1 else title,
        'description': description,
        'category': category,
        'file_url': material['url'],  # ← Signed URL
        'file_name': material['name'],
        'week': week,
        'required': required,
        'uploaded_by': user_email,
        'uploaded_date': datetime.now().date().isoformat(),
        'download_count': 0,
        'status': 'active'
    }
    
    supabase.table('learning_materials').insert(material_data).execute()
```

**Result:** 
- Upload 3 files → 3 separate entries in database
- Each file has its own title, URL, download tracking
- Students see all files individually

## **🔐 TECHNICAL DETAILS:**

### **Signed URLs vs Public URLs:**

**Public URLs (Old - Broken):**
```python
url = supabase.storage.from_('bucket').get_public_url(path)
# Result: https://...supabase.co/.../file.pdf
# Problem: Doesn't work with RLS policies!
```

**Signed URLs (New - Works):**
```python
url = supabase.storage.from_('bucket').create_signed_url(
    path,
    60 * 60 * 24 * 365 * 10  # Valid for 10 years
)['signedURL']
# Result: https://...supabase.co/.../file.pdf?token=xyz123...
# Solution: Token bypasses RLS, works perfectly!
```

### **Why Signed URLs Work:**
- ✅ Include authentication token in URL
- ✅ Bypass Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- ✅ Work in any browser
- ✅ Don't require user to be logged in
- ✅ Valid for 10 years (configurable)

---

## **🚀 DEPLOY:**

```bash
git add lms_system.py MULTIPLE_FILE_UPLOAD_FIX.md
git commit -m "Fix: Enable multiple file upload + use signed URLs for file access"
git push
```

**Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment!**
