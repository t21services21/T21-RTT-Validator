# 🏥 COMPLETE NHS RTT VALIDATION WORKFLOW - Step by Step

**Date:** October 14, 2025  
**Purpose:** Complete validation workflow for TRUE NHS compliance  
**Based on:** Official NHS RTT terminology and national codes

---

## 📚 OFFICIAL NHS TERMINOLOGY

### Core Terms:
- **RTT** = Referral to Treatment
- **PTL** = Patient Tracking List (patients needing treatment by given dates)
- **PBL** = Partial Booking List (patients waiting for FIRST appointment)
- **WL** = Waiting List (for diagnostic test or treatment)
- **TCI DATE** = To Come In Date (date for surgery/diagnostic)
- **DNA** = Did Not Attend
- **OPA/OPD** = Outpatient Appointment
- **N** = New Appointment
- **F** = Follow-up Appointment
- **PATHWAY NUMBER** = Unique identifier for each pathway

### RTT National Codes:
**Clock Start (GREEN):**
- 10 = FIRST ACTIVITY in pathway
- 11 = FIRST ACTIVITY AFTER WATCHFUL WAIT ENDS
- 12 = FIRST ACTIVITY for NEW CONDITION

**Clock Ticking (YELLOW):**
- 20 = SUBSEQUENT ACTIVITY in RTT period
- 21 = Transfer to ANOTHER PROVIDER

**Clock Stop (RED):**
- 30 = FIRST DEFINITIVE TREATMENT
- 31 = ACTIVE MONITORING by PATIENT
- 32 = ACTIVE MONITORING by HOSPITAL
- 33 = DNA first activity
- 34 = Decision NOT TO TREAT
- 35 = PATIENT declined treatment
- 36 = PATIENT died

**Non-RTT (BLUE):**
- 90 = Treatment OCCURRED PREVIOUSLY
- 91 = Activity DURING Active Monitoring
- 92 = DIAGNOSTICS ONLY
