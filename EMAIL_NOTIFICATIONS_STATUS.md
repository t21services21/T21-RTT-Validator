# EMAIL NOTIFICATIONS STATUS - LEVEL 3 ADULT CARE & ALL MODULES

Date: October 24, 2025 12:09 PM
Status: EMAILS NOT SET UP FOR NEW ENROLLMENTS
Action Required: ADD EMAIL NOTIFICATIONS

---

## CURRENT SITUATION:

### WHAT EXISTS:
- Notification system (complete_notification_triggers.py)
- Email service (email_service.py)
- Enrollment system (tquk_course_assignment.py)
- Level 3 Adult Care module (working)

### WHAT'S MISSING:
- NO email sent when learner is enrolled in Level 3 Adult Care
- NO welcome email with instructions
- NO email notifications for new TQUK modules

---

## WHAT HAPPENS NOW WHEN YOU ENROLL A LEARNER:

1. Teacher assigns course via system
2. Enrollment created in database
3. Learner can access the course
4. NO EMAIL SENT (This is the problem!)

---

## WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN:

1. Teacher assigns course
2. Enrollment created
3. EMAIL SENT to learner with:
   - Welcome message
   - Course details
   - Login instructions
   - Getting started guide
   - Contact information

---

## FIX REQUIRED:

### File: tquk_course_assignment.py

Need to add email notification in assign_course_to_learner() function:

BEFORE (Line 82):
```python
result = supabase.table('tquk_enrollments').insert(enrollment_data).execute()
return True, "Course assigned successfully!"
```

AFTER:
```python
result = supabase.table('tquk_enrollments').insert(enrollment_data).execute()

# Send welcome email
from complete_notification_triggers import notify_student_enrolled
notify_student_enrolled(
    student_email=learner_email,
    student_name=learner_email.split('@')[0],
    course_name=TQUK_QUALIFICATIONS[course_id]['name'],
    tier="TQUK Qualification"
)

return True, "Course assigned successfully!"
```
