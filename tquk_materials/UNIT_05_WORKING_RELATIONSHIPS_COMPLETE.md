### 1.2 Describe How to Give Feedback Constructively

#### WHAT IS FEEDBACK?

**Definition:** Information about performance given to help someone improve

**Types:**
- **Positive:** What's going well
- **Constructive:** What could be better
- **Developmental:** How to improve

---

#### WHY GIVE FEEDBACK?

**Benefits:**
- Helps people improve
- Reinforces good practice
- Corrects errors
- Develops skills
- Builds confidence
- Improves performance

**RTT Example:** Feedback helps new coordinator improve validation accuracy

---

#### PRINCIPLES OF CONSTRUCTIVE FEEDBACK:

### 1. BE SPECIFIC

❌ "Your work isn't good enough"
✅ "The patient details in this referral weren't fully validated - we need to check NHS number, DOB, and address"

**Why:** Specific feedback is actionable

**RTT Example:**
❌ "You're not doing RTT validation properly"
✅ "I noticed three referrals today where the priority wasn't assessed. Let me show you how to do that."

---

### 2. BE TIMELY

**Give feedback:**
- Soon after the event
- While fresh in memory
- When there's time to discuss
- Privately for negative feedback

**RTT Example:** Give feedback on validation error same day, not weeks later

---

### 3. FOCUS ON BEHAVIOR, NOT PERSON

❌ "You're careless"
✅ "This referral had some missing information"

**Why:** Behavior can change, personal attacks damage relationships

**RTT Example:**
❌ "You're useless at RTT"
✅ "Let's look at how we can improve your validation process"

---

### 4. BE BALANCED

**Include:**
- What went well (positive)
- What could improve (constructive)
- How to improve (developmental)

**Ratio:** Aim for 3 positive comments to 1 constructive

**RTT Example:**
"You're doing really well with checking patient details and your validation is thorough. I noticed the priority assessment could be more detailed - let me show you the criteria. Overall, you're making great progress."

---

### 5. USE "I" STATEMENTS

❌ "You did this wrong"
✅ "I noticed this could be improved"

**Why:** Less accusatory, more collaborative

**RTT Example:**
❌ "You messed up this referral"
✅ "I noticed this referral needs some additional information"

---

### 6. BE CONSTRUCTIVE, NOT CRITICAL

**Focus on:**
- Solutions, not problems
- Improvement, not blame
- Future, not past
- Learning, not punishment

**RTT Example:**
❌ "You've made so many mistakes with RTT validation"
✅ "Let's work on improving your validation accuracy. Here are some tips that might help."

---

### 7. MAKE IT A DIALOGUE

**Not:**
- One-way lecture
- Telling off
- Monologue

**But:**
- Two-way conversation
- Ask questions
- Listen to response
- Discuss together

**RTT Example:**
"I noticed some challenges with the validation process. What's your perspective? What support do you need?"

---

### 8. OFFER SUPPORT

**Include:**
- How to improve
- Resources available
- Training offered
- Your support

**RTT Example:**
"I can see you're struggling with the new RTT system. Would you like me to go through it with you? I can also arrange some additional training."

---

### 9. END POSITIVELY

**Finish with:**
- Encouragement
- Confidence in improvement
- Appreciation
- Next steps

**RTT Example:**
"I'm confident you'll get the hang of this. You're already doing well with the basics. Let's review your progress next week."

---

#### THE FEEDBACK SANDWICH:

**Structure:**
1. **Positive** (what went well)
2. **Constructive** (what could improve)
3. **Positive** (encouragement)

**RTT Example:**
1. "You're really thorough with checking patient details"
2. "I noticed the priority assessment could be more detailed - let me show you"
3. "You're making great progress and I'm confident you'll master this soon"

**Activity 1.2a:** Practice giving feedback using the sandwich method.

---

#### RECEIVING FEEDBACK:

**Good Practice:**
✅ Listen actively
✅ Don't interrupt
✅ Don't get defensive
✅ Ask questions for clarity
✅ Thank the person
✅ Reflect on feedback
✅ Act on it

**RTT Example:** Colleague gives feedback on your validation - listen, ask questions, improve
