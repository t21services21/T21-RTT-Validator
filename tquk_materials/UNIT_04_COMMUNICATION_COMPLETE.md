#### CHOOSING THE RIGHT METHOD:

**Decision Factors:**

**1. URGENCY**

- Non-urgent = Email/letter

**2. COMPLEXITY**
- Complex = Written + verbal explanation
- Simple = Email or quick call

**3. FORMALITY**
- Formal = Letter
- Informal = Email or call

**4. AUDIENCE**
- Senior management = Formal written
- Colleagues = Email or call
- Patients = Letter or phone

**5. RECORD NEEDED**
- Yes = Written
- No = Verbal

**6. SENSITIVITY**
- Sensitive = Face-to-face
- Routine = Email

**RTT Communication Matrix:**

| Situation | Method | Why |
|-----------|--------|-----|
| Appointment confirmation | Letter | Formal, record, patient needs written details |
| Urgent breach alert | Phone + email | Urgent, needs immediate action + record |
| Monthly performance | Report + presentation | Complex data, visual, discussion |
| Quick query | Phone/email | Simple, quick response |
| Patient complaint | Face-to-face | Sensitive, empathy, relationship |

### 1.3 Explain Importance of Correct Grammar, Sentence Structure, Punctuation, Spelling

#### WHY ACCURACY MATTERS:

**1. PROFESSIONALISM**
- Reflects on you and organization
- Shows attention to detail
- Builds credibility
- Creates good impression

**Poor Example:**
"we need too book the patient in there not happy about the wait"

**Good Example:**
"We need to book the patient in. They're not happy about the wait."

**Impact:** Poor grammar looks unprofessional and damages trust reputation

---

**2. CLARITY**
- Ensures message is understood
- Prevents misunderstandings
- Avoids confusion
- Saves time

**Poor Example:**
"The patient said the doctor said they should come back next week."
(Who should come back? Patient or doctor?)

**Good Example:**
"The patient said the doctor told them to return next week."

**Impact:** Clear communication prevents errors

---

**3. ACCURACY**
- Conveys correct meaning
- Prevents mistakes
- Ensures compliance
- Avoids legal issues

**Poor Example:**
"Patient declined treatment" vs "Patient declined, treatment"
(Completely different meanings!)

**Impact:** Incorrect punctuation can change meaning entirely

---

**4. CREDIBILITY**
- Shows competence
- Builds trust
- Demonstrates education
- Inspires confidence

**Poor Example:**
"Your appointment is on wendsday at 10am dont be late"

**Good Example:**
"Your appointment is on Wednesday at 10:00 AM. Please arrive on time."

**Impact:** Errors undermine confidence in your abilities

---

#### COMMON ERRORS:

**SPELLING:**

**Their/There/They're:**
- Their = belonging to them ("their appointment")
- There = place ("over there")
- They're = they are ("they're waiting")

**Your/You're:**
- Your = belonging to you ("your appointment")
- You're = you are ("you're next")

**Its/It's:**
- Its = belonging to it ("its location")
- It's = it is ("it's ready")

**To/Too/Two:**
- To = direction ("go to clinic")
- Too = also/excessive ("too long")
- Two = number ("two weeks")

**Activity 1.3a:** Correct 20 sentences with spelling errors.

---

**GRAMMAR:**

**Subject-Verb Agreement:**
❌ "The patient are waiting"
✅ "The patient is waiting"

**Tense Consistency:**
❌ "The patient arrived and asks for help"
✅ "The patient arrived and asked for help"

**Pronoun Agreement:**
❌ "Each patient must bring their letter" (each = singular, their = plural)
✅ "Each patient must bring his or her letter" or "All patients must bring their letters"

---

**PUNCTUATION:**

**Full Stops:**
- End sentences
- After abbreviations (Dr., Mr.)

**Commas:**
- Separate items in list
- After introductory phrases
- Around additional information

**Apostrophes:**
- Possession ("patient's file" = one patient, "patients' files" = multiple patients)
- Contractions ("don't" = do not)

**Colons:**
- Introduce lists
- Introduce explanations

**Semicolons:**
- Link related sentences
- Separate complex list items

**RTT Examples:**

❌ "The patients appointment is at 10am bring your letter"
✅ "The patient's appointment is at 10:00 AM. Please bring your letter."

❌ "We need to book the following patients john smith jane doe and bob jones"
✅ "We need to book the following patients: John Smith, Jane Doe, and Bob Jones."

**Activity 1.3b:** Add correct punctuation to unpunctuated text.

---

**SENTENCE STRUCTURE:**

**Simple Sentence:**
One main clause
"The patient arrived."

**Compound Sentence:**
Two main clauses joined
"The patient arrived, and the doctor saw them."

**Complex Sentence:**
Main clause + subordinate clause
"When the patient arrived, the doctor saw them."

**Avoid:**
- Run-on sentences (too long)
- Sentence fragments (incomplete)
- Overly complex structures

**Good Practice:**
- Vary sentence length
- Keep most sentences under 20 words
- One main idea per sentence

**Activity 1.3c:** Improve poorly structured sentences.
