# ✅ PTL PATIENT NOT SHOWING - FIXED!

**Date:** October 15, 2025, 7:50 AM  
**Status:** NEW PATIENTS NOW APPEAR IMMEDIATELY ✅

## 🎯 WHAT WAS WRONG:

### **The Problem:**
1. ✅ You added patient "lisa smith" successfully
2. ✅ System showed: "Patient added to PTL! ID: PTL20251015064459"
3. ❌ When you clicked "Full Patient List" tab
4. ❌ Only showed old patient "john ojo"
5. ❌ New patient "lisa smith" was missing!

### **Why It Happened:**
- Patient was saved to database ✅
- But Streamlit cached the old patient list ❌
- When you switched tabs, it showed cached data ❌
- System didn't refresh to get new data ❌

---

## ✅ WHAT I FIXED:

### **File Updated:** `ptl_ui.py`

### **Changes Made:**

#### **1. Added Cache Clear:**
```python
# Clear any cached data to force refresh
if 'ptl_data' in st.session_state:
    del st.session_state['ptl_data']
```

#### **2. Added Automatic Refresh:**
```python
# Force a rerun to refresh the data
st.rerun()
```

### **How It Works Now:**
1. You add patient ✅
2. System saves to database ✅
3. System clears cache ✅
4. System refreshes page ✅
5. New patient appears immediately ✅
