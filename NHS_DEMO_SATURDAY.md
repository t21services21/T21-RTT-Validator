## üí° OBJECTION HANDLING

### **"It's too expensive"**

### **"We need to think about it"**
> "Absolutely, this is an important decision. What specific information can I provide to help you make the decision? Would a trial help?"

### **"We're already working with another provider"**
> "That's great! What are they providing? [Listen] Here's what makes us different: [highlight unique features]. Would you be open to a comparison?"

### **"We don't have budget this year"**
> "I understand budget constraints. When does your next budget year start? We can lock in current pricing now for a start date then. Also, we offer payment plans that might fit current budget."

### **"I need to discuss with my team"**
> "Of course. Who else needs to be involved in this decision? Would it help if I presented to them as well? I'm happy to run another demo for your team."
