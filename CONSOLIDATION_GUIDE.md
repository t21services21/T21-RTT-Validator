    st.subheader("🏥 Patient Administration Hub")
    
    tabs = st.tabs([
        "👤 Registration",
        "📁 Pathways", 
        "📋 Episodes",
        "📋 Waiting List",
        "📊 DNA/Cancel",
        "⚠️ Alerts"
    ])
    
    with tabs[0]:
        from patient_registration_ui import render_patient_registration
        render_patient_registration()
    
    with tabs[1]:
        from pathway_management_ui import render_pathway_management
        render_pathway_management()
    
    # etc...
```

**Benefits:**
- All existing code still works
