# ✅ PER-USER DATA SYSTEM - HOW IT WORKS

**Date:** October 15, 2025, 8:30 AM  
**Status:** FULLY CONFIGURED - EACH USER SEES ONLY THEIR DATA ✅

---

## 🎯 HOW IT WORKS:

### **Every User Has Their Own Private Data:**

When a student/user logs in:
1. ✅ System captures their email address
2. ✅ All data saved with their email
3. ✅ Only they can see their data
4. ✅ Data persists forever in Supabase
5. ✅ Available every time they login

---

## 🔐 DATA PRIVACY & SEPARATION:

### **User A (student1@example.com):**
- ✅ Sees only their PTL patients
- ✅ Sees only their MDT meetings
- ✅ Sees only their appointments
- ✅ Sees only their practice data
- ❌ Cannot see User B's data

### **User B (student2@example.com):**
- ✅ Sees only their PTL patients
- ✅ Sees only their MDT meetings
- ✅ Sees only their appointments
- ✅ Sees only their practice data
- ❌ Cannot see User A's data

---

## 📊 MODULES WITH PER-USER DATA:

```python
user_email = get_current_user_email()
patients = get_ptl_patients_for_user(user_email)
# Each user sees only THEIR patients
```

**What This Means:**
- ✅ Add patients → Saved to YOUR account
- ✅ Login tomorrow → See YOUR patients

- ✅ Separate from other users

---

### **4. Cancer Pathways** ✅
```python
user_email = get_current_user_email()

# Each user sees only THEIR cancer pathways
```

**What This Means:**
- ✅ Track cancer patients → YOUR patients
- ✅ Monitor 62-day targets → YOUR targets

- ✅ Private portfolio

---

### **5. Medical Secretary AI** ✅
```python
user_email = get_current_user_email()

- ✅ Personal task list

---

### **6. Data Quality System** ✅
```python
user_email = get_current_user_email()
audits = get_audits_for_user(user_email)

## 🔒 DATA SECURITY:

### **How Data is Protected:**

1. **Email-Based Separation:**

   SELECT * FROM ptl_patients WHERE user_email = 'student1@example.com'
   ```
   - Only returns data for that specific user
   - Other users' data is invisible

2. **Supabase Row-Level Security:**
   - Database enforces user separation
   - Even if code had a bug, database protects data
   - Industry-standard security

3. **No Cross-User Access:**
   - User A cannot query User B's data
   - User B cannot query User A's data
   - Complete isolation

## 💡 TECHNICAL DETAILS:

### **How User Email is Captured:**

```python
# During login (pages/student_login.py, pages/nhs_login.py, etc.)
st.session_state['user_email'] = user.email
st.session_state['logged_in'] = True

# In system modules
def get_current_user_email():
    return st.session_state.get('user_email', 'demo@t21services.co.uk')

# When saving data
user_email = get_current_user_email()
add_ptl_patient(user_email, patient_data)

# When loading data
user_email = get_current_user_email()
patients = get_ptl_patients_for_user(user_email)
