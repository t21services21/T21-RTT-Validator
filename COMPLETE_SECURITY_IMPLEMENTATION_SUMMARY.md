## **üìû SUPPORT & MAINTENANCE:**

### **Common Issues & Solutions:**

- Solution: Use app password (not regular password) for Gmail
- Solution: Verify SMTP port 587 is not blocked

**Issue: "Device fingerprint not working"**
- Solution: System uses UUID fallback (this is normal and expected)

**Issue: "Users complaining about being blocked"**
- Solution: They're at device limit or have concurrent session
- Solution: Have them remove old devices from Security Dashboard

**Issue: "Session timeout too aggressive"**
- Solution: Increase from 15 to 30 minutes in config
