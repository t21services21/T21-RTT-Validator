# üêõ CRITICAL BUG FIX - PTL Not Showing Patients

**Date:** 2025-10-10 18:24  
**Status:** FIXED

---

## The Bug:
Patient gets added (success message shows) but doesn't appear in patient list.

## Root Cause:
In `ptl_system.py`, appointments and events were being saved as JSON **strings** instead of JSON **objects**:

```python
# WRONG (was doing this):
'appointments': json.dumps([])  # Saves as STRING
'events': json.dumps([{...}])   # Saves as STRING
```

Supabase JSONB columns expect actual JSON objects, not strings!

## The Fix:
```python
# CORRECT (now doing this):
'appointments': []  # Saves as JSON array
'events': [{...}]   # Saves as JSON array
```

---

## File Modified:
- `ptl_system.py` (lines 204-210)

---

## What to Do:
1. **Push this fix to GitHub** (just ptl_system.py)
2. **Wait 2 minutes** for deployment
3. **Test again:**
   - Add patient
   - Click "Full Patient List"
   - **Patient should now appear!** ‚úÖ

---

## Why This Happened:
The insert was working (that's why you got success message), but the data format was wrong for JSONB columns. Supabase was either rejecting it silently or storing it incorrectly.

**PUSH THIS FIX NOW!**
