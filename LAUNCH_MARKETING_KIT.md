**Email 2 (Day 1): Which Path?**
Subject: Data Analyst vs Scientist vs Engineer - which one?

Hi [Name],

The #1 question I get: "Which data career should I pursue?"

Here's my simple decision framework:

DATA ANALYST
- Best for: People who love business insights
- Salary: £30K-£60K
- Tools: SQL, Excel, Tableau
- Fastest path: 3-4 months

DATA SCIENTIST
- Best for: People who love math & models
- Salary: £50K-£100K
- Tools: Python, ML, Statistics
- Path: 4-6 months

DATA ENGINEER
- Best for: People who love building systems
- Salary: £55K-£110K
- Tools: Spark, Airflow, Cloud
- Path: 5-7 months

**Email 3 (Day 2): The #1 Skill**
Subject: The skill that gets you hired (it's not Python)

Hi [Name],

Everyone thinks data jobs are all about technical skills.

Python, SQL, Machine Learning, etc.

But after helping 500+ people get hired, I've learned the truth:

**The #1 skill is BUSINESS PROBLEM SOLVING.**

Here's what I mean:

BAD: "I built a model with 95% accuracy"
GOOD: "I built a model that saved £2M by reducing churn 25%"

BAD: "I know how to use pandas"
GOOD: "I analyzed customer data and found a $10K/month opportunity"

Employers don't care about your tools. They care about BUSINESS RESULTS.

That's why our program focuses on REAL company problems:
- Airbnb pricing optimization
- Uber demand forecasting
- Netflix churn prediction

You learn to think like a business person, not just a coder.

Tomorrow: I'll show you how to build a portfolio that proves you
can solve business problems.

Best,
[Your Name]

**Post 1: Transformation Story**
```
3 months ago, Sarah was a teacher earning £28K.

Today, she's a Data Analyst at Deliveroo earning £55K.

Here's exactly what she did:

1️⃣ Chose Data Analyst pathway (not Data Scientist)
   → Faster path, still great salary

2️⃣ Built 20 projects (not 100)
   → Quality over quantity matters

3️⃣ Got 3 verified skill badges
   → Employers skipped technical screens

4️⃣ Applied to 50 companies in 2 weeks
   → High volume = higher success

5️⃣ Leveraged our hiring partner network
   → Fast-tracked to interviews

Result: 5 interviews, 3 offers, 1 dream job.

You can do this too.

Why spend £15K on a bootcamp when you can spend £997?

BOOTCAMPS:
❌ £10K-£15K
❌ 3 months full-time (can't work)
❌ 100 coding challenges
❌ 5-10 projects
❌ Generic career support

OUR PLATFORM:
✅ £997-£6,997
✅ Self-paced (work while learning)
✅ 500+ coding challenges
✅ 100 real company projects
✅ AI mock interviews + job guarantee

Same outcomes. 1/3 the price. Your schedule.

**Post 3: Problem/Solution**
```
The DATA JOB PARADOX:

Companies: "We can't find qualified candidates!"
Job Seekers: "I can't get interviews!"

Why?

❌ Most training teaches THEORY, not PRACTICE
❌ Portfolios full of Titanic datasets
❌ No interview preparation
❌ Zero employer connections

We fixed this:

✅ 500+ hands-on coding challenges
✅ 100 real company-style projects
✅ AI-powered mock interviews
✅ 50+ hiring partners
✅ 95% job placement rate

The result? Both sides are happy.

Red flags in data job postings:

🚩 "Must know 15+ technologies"
🚩 "Rockstar/Ninja/Wizard"
🚩 "Wearing many hats"
🚩 Salary: "Competitive"
🚩 "Fast-paced environment" (= chaos)

Green flags:

✅ Clear responsibilities

---

Day 4:
Your data portfolio needs:

✅ 3-5 quality projects
✅ Real business problems
✅ Messy data (not pristine CSVs)

✅ Business impact
✅ Clean code on GitHub

Don't need:

❌ 50 projects
❌ Fancy website

Quality > Quantity

---

Day 5:
Interview tip:

When asked "Tell me about yourself"

DON'T say:
"I'm passionate about data..."

DO say:
"I transitioned to data because [specific reason].
I've built [specific projects] that [specific impact].
I'm excited about this role because [specific reason]."

Be specific. Always.
