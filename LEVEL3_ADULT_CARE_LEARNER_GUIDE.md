### **3. Reflective Accounts**

**What:** You reflect on your practice

**Template:**
```
REFLECTIVE ACCOUNT

Unit: [Unit Number and Name]
Learning Outcome: [Which LO this covers]
Date of Incident: [Date]
Word Count: [500-1000 words]

SITUATION:
Describe what happened. Who was involved? Where? When?

Example:
"On 12th October 2025, I was supporting Mrs. Smith (78 years old) 
with dementia during her morning personal care routine in her room 
at Sunshine Care Home."

TASK:
What did you need to do? What was your role?

Example:
"My role was to assist Mrs. Smith with washing and dressing while 
maintaining her dignity and respecting her choices, in line with 
her care plan."

ACTION:
What did you actually do? Be specific and detailed.

Example:
"I approached Mrs. Smith calmly and introduced myself. I explained 
each step before doing it. When she refused to change her cardigan, 
I respected her choice and documented it. I maintained privacy by 
closing curtains and door. I used her preferred name 'Betty' as 
stated in her care plan."

RESULT:
What was the outcome? What happened?

Example:
"Mrs. Smith was calm throughout and smiled when I used her preferred 
name. She completed her personal care with dignity maintained. I 
documented the care provided and her refusal to change cardigan in 
her notes."

REFLECTION:
What did you learn? What would you do differently? How does this 
relate to the unit?

Example:
"This experience reinforced the importance of person-centred care. 
By respecting Mrs. Smith's choice about the cardigan, I maintained 
her autonomy while ensuring her care needs were met. In future, I 
would explore why she didn't want to change it - perhaps it has 
sentimental value. This relates to Unit 3 (Person-Centred Care) as 
it shows respecting individual choices and preferences."

LEARNING OUTCOMES COVERED:
- LO1: Understand person-centred approaches
- LO2: Implement person-centred care

Unit: Unit 4 - Safeguarding

Questions and Responses:

Q1: Tell me about a time you identified a safeguarding concern.

A: "Last month, I noticed bruising on Mr. Thompson's arm that wasn't 
documented. I immediately reported it to my manager following our 
safeguarding policy. We completed a body map and submitted a 
safeguarding alert to the local authority. The concern was 
investigated and found to be accidental, but I followed correct 
procedure."

Q2: What are the different types of abuse?

A: "Physical, emotional, sexual, financial, neglect, discriminatory, 
institutional, and self-neglect. In my workplace, I'm most vigilant 
for signs of neglect and financial abuse as these can be subtle."

Q3: What would you do if a service user disclosed abuse?

A: "I would listen without judgment, reassure them, not promise 
confidentiality, document exactly what they said (not my 
interpretation), and report immediately to my manager and follow 
safeguarding procedures. I would not investigate myself."

### **6. Case Studies**

**What:** Detailed analysis of a care situation

**Template:**
```
CASE STUDY

Unit: [Unit Number and Name]
Title: [Brief title]
Word Count: [1000-2000 words]

INTRODUCTION:
Brief overview of the case

Example:
"This case study examines how I supported Service User B, a 
gentleman with advanced dementia, to maintain his dignity and 
independence during end-of-life care."

BACKGROUND:
Who is the service user? What's their situation?

Example:
"Service User B is an 82-year-old gentleman with advanced vascular 
dementia. He has been a resident at our care home for 3 years. 
Recently, his health deteriorated and he entered end-of-life care."

CARE NEEDS IDENTIFIED:
What did they need?

Example:
"- Pain management
- Maintaining dignity
- Family involvement
- Comfort care
- Emotional support"

CARE PROVIDED:
What did you/the team do?

Example:
"I worked with the nursing team to:
- Administer pain relief as prescribed
- Provide mouth care every 2 hours
- Reposition regularly for comfort
- Play his favorite music
- Support family to be present
- Maintain privacy and dignity"

PERSON-CENTRED APPROACH:
How did you respect their wishes/preferences?

Example:
"We followed Service User B's advance care plan which stated:
- He wanted to remain in the care home (not hospital)
- He wanted his family present
- He enjoyed classical music
- He preferred male carers for personal care

We honored all these preferences."

CHALLENGES:
What difficulties did you face?

Example:
"Managing pain was challenging as Service User B couldn't verbally 
communicate. We used pain assessment tools and observed non-verbal 
cues like facial expressions and body language."

OUTCOMES:
What happened?

Example:
"Service User B passed away peacefully with his family present. 
The family thanked us for maintaining his dignity and comfort. 
This was a positive end-of-life experience."

REFLECTION:
What did you learn?

Example:
"This experience taught me the importance of advance care planning 
and person-centred care at end of life. I learned to recognize 
non-verbal pain cues and the value of small comforts like music. 
I would ensure earlier family involvement in future cases."

LEARNING OUTCOMES COVERED:
- Unit 3 LO1: Person-centred approaches
- Unit 10 LO2: End-of-life care
