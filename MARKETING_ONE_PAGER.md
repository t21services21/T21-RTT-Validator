## 4Ô∏è‚É£ PRESS RELEASE - PRODUCT LAUNCH

### FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

**Liverpool Healthcare Tech Company Launches AI Platform to Address NHS Administration Crisis**

*T21 Services Limited unveils comprehensive training and automation platform designed specifically for UK NHS workflows*

---

**Liverpool, England - [Date]** - T21 Services Limited (Company No: 13091053), a Liverpool-based healthcare technology company, today announced the official launch of the T21 Healthcare Intelligence Platform, the UK's first integrated system combining NHS professional training with AI-powered operational automation.

**Addressing Critical NHS Challenges**

The platform addresses three urgent needs facing NHS trusts across the UK:

1. **Workforce Shortage:** NHS trusts struggle to find qualified RTT coordinators, cancer pathway administrators, and medical secretaries. Traditional training programs take 6-12 months and cost upwards of ¬£5,000 per student.

2. **Administrative Inefficiency:** Manual RTT validation currently takes 2 hours per patient. With typical trusts managing 50,000+ patients, this creates an impossible workload leading to staff burnout and increased error rates.

3. **Cost Prohibitive Systems:** Existing healthcare IT systems like Epic and Cerner cost ¬£10-40 million to implement and were not designed for UK-specific NHS workflows.

**The Solution: Seven Integrated Modules**

The T21 Platform offers seven AI-powered modules:

- RTT & Pathway Intelligence (validation in 60 seconds vs 2 hours manually)
- Cancer Pathway Management (2WW and 62-day tracking)
- MDT Coordination Suite
- Intelligent Appointment System
- Medical Secretary AI
- Data Quality & Governance
- Professional Training Academy (188 hands-on scenarios)

**Proven Results**

Early NHS trust partners have reported:
- 78% reduction in administrative time
- ¬£2-3M annual cost savings
- 99.7% AI accuracy rates
- Zero RTT breaches after implementation
- 65% increase in staff satisfaction

For students, the platform reduces training time from 12 months to 3-6 months while cutting costs by 80% (¬£299-999 vs traditional ¬£5,000+ courses).

**Built for UK NHS**

"Unlike American systems that are retrofitted for UK use, we built T21 specifically for NHS workflows," said [Your Name], Founder of T21 Services Limited. "Our AI understands 18-week RTT pathways, 2WW cancer referrals, and UK-specific regulatory requirements."

**Company Background**

T21 Services Limited was incorporated on 18 December 2020 and is based in Liverpool, England. The company focuses on healthcare training and technology solutions designed specifically for the UK market.

**Pricing and Availability**

The platform is available now:
- Students: Free 48-hour trial, then ¬£299-999 per year
- NHS Organizations: ¬£100k-300k annually (custom pricing)
- Training Providers: Partnership/licensing models available
