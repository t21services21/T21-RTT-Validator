**Date:** October 31, 2025  
**Status:** CRITICAL - ALL SITES DOWN

## 🔴 WHAT I SEE FROM YOUR SCREENSHOTS:

❌ "This site has been temporarily disabled, please try again later"

### **Training Subdomain (training.t21services.co.uk):**
❌ "This site has been temporarily disabled, please try again later"

### **WordPress Dashboard:**
❌ "Error loading data"

## 🔍 THE PROBLEMS:

### **1. WordPress is Broken**
- Core files corrupted

### **2. Site Disabled**
- One.com has temporarily disabled your site
- Probably due to errors or resource issues
- Need to fix or replace

### **3. Multiple Subdomains Down**
