## 🚀 IMPLEMENTATION OPTIONS:

### **Option 1: I Update All Documents Now** ⚡
**What I need from you:**
1. Your full head office address
2. Any additional phone numbers
3. Website URL (if different from t21services.co.uk)
4. Any other contact details

**What I'll do:**
1. Add professional header to all 27 units
2. Add footer to all documents
3. Remove any simulation language
4. Make everything official
5. Update in 30 minutes

---

### **Option 2: You Provide Address, I Create Template** 📝
**What I'll do:**
1. Create a Word/PDF template with your branding
2. You can copy-paste into documents
3. More manual but you have control

---

### **Option 3: Add to Platform Dynamically** 🖥️
**What I'll do:**
1. Update the document library module
2. Add header/footer automatically when viewing
3. Add header/footer automatically when downloading
4. No need to update individual files

---

## 💡 RECOMMENDED APPROACH:

**I recommend Option 3 (Dynamic):**

**Why:**
- ✅ No need to update 27+ files manually
- ✅ Easy to change address later
- ✅ Consistent across all documents
- ✅ Professional presentation
- ✅ Automatic on all downloads

**How it works:**
1. Store your company details in one place
2. When viewing/downloading documents, automatically add header/footer
3. When exporting to PDF, include branding
4. One update = all documents updated
