### **1. StreamlitDuplicateElementId - LOGOUT BUTTON** ✅
**Error:**
```
StreamlitDuplicateElementId: Multiple identical st.sidebar.button("🚪 Logout") 
widgets with no unique key
```

**Root Cause:**
- TWO Logout buttons in different files
- Line 1318 in `app.py` - NO KEY
- Line 305 in `sidebar_manager.py` - HAS KEY

**Fix:**
```python
# BEFORE (❌ WRONG)
if st.sidebar.button("🚪 Logout"):

# AFTER (✅ FIXED)
if st.sidebar.button("🚪 Logout", key="sidebar_logout_button"):
```

**File Modified:** `app.py` line 1318

### **2. ADMIN PANEL NOT LOADING** ✅
**Issue:**
- Admin Panel showed "Loading admin panel..." forever
- Never actually rendered the admin panel content

# OLD CODE (❌ WRONG)
with tabs[1]:
    st.info("Loading admin panel...")
    # Never actually calls render functions!
```

**Fix:**
- Added complete admin panel rendering code
- 10 admin tabs now functional:
