# ‚úÖ QUESTION COUNT FIX - From 4 to 15-20!

**Date:** October 17, 2025 at 4:28pm  
**Issue:** Only getting 4 questions instead of 15-20  
**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED!

---

## **‚ùå THE PROBLEM YOU SAW:**

GPT-4 was working and parsing successfully, but only returned **4 questions**:
- 1 Medical Terminology question
- 1 Data Management question  
- 1 Leadership question
- 1 Prioritization question

**You expected:** 15-20 job-specific questions  
**You got:** Only 4 questions

---

## **üîç WHY IT ONLY GENERATED 4:**

The prompt said "Generate 15-20 questions" but:
1. Token limit was too low (6000 tokens)
2. Prompt wasn't emphatic enough about the requirement
3. GPT-4 hit the token limit and stopped early

---

## **‚úÖ THE FIX:**

### **1. Made Prompt VERY Clear**

**Before:**
```
"Generate 15-20 questions..."
```

**After:**
```
"Generate EXACTLY 15-20 questions (not less!)
...
CRITICAL: You MUST generate at least 15 questions. More is better (up to 20)."
```

### **2. Increased Tokens**

**Before:** 6000 tokens (not enough for 15-20 questions!)  
**After:** 8000 tokens (enough for 15-20 questions with answers)

### **3. Made Requirements Explicit**

Added numbered requirements:
1. Generate EXACTLY 15-20 questions
2. All must be job-specific
3. Include mix of technical, competency, scenario, motivation
4. Each needs answer + tips

---

## **üìä WHAT YOU'LL GET NOW:**

### **Before (What you just saw):**
- ‚úÖ GPT-4 worked
- ‚úÖ Parsed successfully
- ‚ùå **Only 4 questions!**

### **After (Once deployed):**
