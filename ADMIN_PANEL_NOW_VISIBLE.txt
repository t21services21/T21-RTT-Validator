                 ADMIN PANEL NOW VISIBLE FOR STAFF/ADMIN!
================================================================================

PROBLEM FIXED:
The Admin Panel wasn't showing in the sidebar for staff/admin users because
get_accessible_modules() only returned the 7 automation modules, not the
management features.

================================================================================

✅ WHAT I FIXED:

FILE: app.py (lines 818-824)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Added automatic inclusion of admin features for admin/staff users:

if user_role in ['admin', 'super_admin', 'staff', 'staff_trainer', 'staff_support']:
    admin_features = [
        "👥 Staff Management",
        "🔧 Admin Panel"  # This is where you manage all users!
    ]
    accessible_modules = accessible_modules + admin_features

Now admin and staff will see:
✓ 👥 Staff Management
✓ 🔧 Admin Panel  ← YOUR USER MANAGEMENT IS HERE!
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

================================================================================

🔧 WHERE TO FIND USER MANAGEMENT:

After you login as staff/admin, look in the LEFT SIDEBAR:

┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
