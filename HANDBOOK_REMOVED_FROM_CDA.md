# LEARNER HANDBOOK REMOVED FROM CDA SUBMISSION

Date: October 24, 2025 10:21 AM
Issue: CDA document incorrectly listed Learner Handbook
Status: FIXED - Handbook removed

## THE PROBLEM:

CDA Submission Package incorrectly listed:
1. LEARNER HANDBOOK
   File: LEVEL3_ADULT_CARE_LEARNER_HANDBOOK.md
   Pages: 50+

Problems:
- You dont have this file
- TQUK doesnt require it for CDA approval
- Confusing and incorrect

## WHAT TQUK ACTUALLY REQUIRES:

For CDA Approval:
1. CDA Submission Package (overview and mapping)
2. Sample Unit Materials (3 units minimum)
3. Assessment Templates
4. Staff Qualification Certificates

NO HANDBOOK REQUIRED!

## WHAT WAS FIXED:

Removed from CDA Submission Package:
- Section 1: LEARNER HANDBOOK (deleted)
- Renumbered remaining sections

New Structure:
1. UNIT LEARNING MATERIALS (3 units)
2. ASSESSMENT TEMPLATES (7 templates)
3. QUALITY ASSURANCE TOOLS (3 tools)

## WHAT YOU SUBMIT TO TQUK:

PDF Attachments (7 files):
1. CDA Submission Package
2. Unit 1: Duty of Care
3. Unit 2: Equality and Diversity
4. Unit 3: Person-Centred Care
5. Assessment Pack Templates
6. Your Assessor Certificate
7. Your IQA Certificate

NO HANDBOOK!

## WHY NO HANDBOOK:

TQUK CDA approval focuses on:
- Assessment methods (how you assess)
- Learning materials (what learners study)
- Quality assurance (how you ensure quality)
- Staff qualifications (who assesses)

Learner handbook is:
- Internal document for your centre
- Not required for CDA approval
- Can be created later for learners
- Not part of assessment materials

## PUSH THIS FIX:

Use GitHub Desktop to push:
- TQUK_CDA_SUBMISSION_PACKAGE.md (handbook removed)

Then deploy and download clean PDF.

## SUMMARY:

Problem: CDA listed non-existent handbook
Fix: Removed handbook section
Result: Clean accurate CDA submission
Status: Ready to push and deploy

HANDBOOK NOT NEEDED FOR TQUK CDA APPROVAL!
