# 🧠 T21 PLATFORM-WIDE LEARNING SYSTEM

## Overview

The T21 Learning System enables the **entire platform** to learn from user interactions and continuously improve. Every module gets smarter as more people use it.

---

## ✅ What's Implemented (Phase 1)

### **1. Core Infrastructure**
- ✅ **learning_system_core.py** - Central learning engine
  - SQLite database for storing examples, feedback, patterns, analytics
  - Pattern detection and insight generation
  - Cross-module analytics

- ✅ **data_anonymizer.py** - GDPR/NHS-compliant anonymization
  - Removes patient-identifiable information
  - Preserves clinical/administrative patterns
  - Validation checks for safety

- ✅ **letter_interpreter_rag.py** - RAG system for Letter Interpreter
  - Retrieves similar validated examples
  - Builds enhanced prompts with context
  - Collects feedback and corrections

### **2. Letter Interpreter Integration**
- ✅ **RAG-Enhanced Interpretations**
  - AI sees 3 similar validated examples before analyzing
  - Learns from YOUR trust's specific patterns
  - Gets more accurate over time

- ✅ **Feedback Collection Interface**
  - "Perfect - Save as Example" button
  - "Wrong - Let Me Correct" button
  - Correction form for validators
  - Automatic anonymization before storage

- ✅ **Learning Statistics Dashboard**
  - Total examples collected
  - Examples by category
  - Improvement suggestions
  - Coverage gaps identified

---

### **Tables Created:**

**1. example_library**
- Stores validated examples from all modules
- Anonymized input/output pairs
- Quality scoring and usage tracking
- Specialty and scenario categorization

**2. feedback**
- User corrections and validations
- AI suggestion vs user correction
- Improvement tracking

**3. patterns**
- Automatically detected trends
- Common mistakes
- Frequency analysis

**4. analytics**
- Usage metrics
- Accuracy improvements
- Time savings

**5. insights**
- Auto-generated recommendations
- Action items for improvement
- Priority-based suggestions

## 🚀 How To Use

### **For Validators (Using Letter Interpreter):**

1. **Upload and interpret letter** as normal
2. **Review the interpretation**
3. **Provide feedback:**
   - Click "✅ Perfect" → Saves as validated example
   - Click "❌ Wrong" → Enter correct comment → System learns

4. **Check learning stats** in expander to see progress

### **What Happens Behind The Scenes:**

```
User validates interpretation
    ↓
Letter anonymized (patient data removed)
    ↓
Saved to example_library
    ↓
Next similar letter → System retrieves this example
    ↓
AI sees your validated example as context
    ↓
Better interpretation for next user!
```

## 📈 Expected Improvements

### **Week 1: 10-20 examples**
- System starts recognizing common scenarios
- Minor accuracy improvement (5-10%)

### **Month 1: 50-100 examples**
- Specialty-specific expertise developing
- 20-30% accuracy improvement
- Faster validation times

### **Month 3: 200-300 examples**
- Trust-specific commenting style learned
- 40-50% accuracy improvement
- Handles most routine letters perfectly

### **Month 6: 500+ examples**
- Expert-level interpretations
- 60-70% accuracy improvement
- Ready for advanced features (fine-tuning)

## 🔐 Privacy & Compliance

### **What Gets Anonymized:**
- ✅ Patient names
- ✅ NHS numbers
- ✅ Addresses and postcodes
- ✅ Phone numbers
- ✅ Email addresses
- ✅ Dates of birth

### **What Gets Preserved:**
- ✅ Clinical conditions (for learning)
- ✅ Specialty information
- ✅ RTT codes and pathways
- ✅ Commenting patterns
- ✅ Letter structure

### **GDPR Compliance:**
- All data anonymized before storage
- No patient-identifiable information retained
- Validation checks before saving
- Can delete examples if needed

## 💡 Tips For Maximum Learning

### **For Validators:**
1. **Always provide feedback** - Even "Perfect" helps!
2. **Correct when wrong** - This is most valuable
3. **Add specialty info** when known
4. **Save diverse examples** - Different scenarios help

### **For Administrators:**
1. **Encourage feedback** - Gamify with leaderboards?
2. **Review monthly stats** - Identify gaps
3. **Share successes** - Show improvement metrics
4. **Export examples** - Share between trusts

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **"Learning system not available" warning:**
- Check that all 3 Python files are in same directory
- Restart Streamlit app

### **Database errors:**
- Delete `t21_learning_system.db` to reset
- Database will be recreated automatically

### **No examples showing:**
- Need to validate at least 1 interpretation first
- Click "Perfect - Save as Example" button
