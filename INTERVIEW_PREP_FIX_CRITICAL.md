## **TECHNICAL DETAILS:**

### **Old Code (Broken):**
```python
# Only generated 5 answers!
example_answers = generate_example_answers(questions[:5])
```

### **New Code (Fixed):**
```python
# Generate answers for ALL questions!
from interview_answers_complete import get_complete_answer
example_answers = []
for q in questions:
    answer_data = get_complete_answer(q['question'], q['category'])
    example_answers.append({
        'question': q['question'],
        'example_answer': answer_data['answer'],
        'tips': answer_data['tips']
    })
```

**Key Change:** Loop through ALL questions, not just first 5!

---

## **FALLBACK SYSTEM:**

Even if a question is new/unusual, the system has a **default answer generator**:

```python
def generate_default_answer(question, category):
    """
    Generate a professional answer even if not in database
    Ensures EVERY question gets an answer - NO EXCEPTIONS!
    """
```

**This guarantees:** Even questions we haven't seen before get professional guidance!
