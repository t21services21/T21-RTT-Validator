   The system uses TWO user databases:

   - users_database.json (OLD - legacy student accounts)
   
   Admin panel shows BOTH! No users are hidden.

2. LEGACY ACCOUNTS:
   Users from users_database.json show as "Active (Legacy Account)"
   They have full access but limited admin features.

3. IF YOU SEE "ERROR LOADING":
   - Click "🔍 Show Full Error Details" to see the full error
   - Report the error details for quick fix
   - Other tabs should still work

4. PASSWORD HASHES:
