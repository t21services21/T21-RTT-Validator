Data Science Foundations (Pathway 1)
Global, sector-agnostic beginner-to-junior data science programme.

This module follows the same overall structure as the TQUK modules:
- Course overview
- Learning materials
- Labs & projects
- Assessments
- Evidence tracking
- Documents
- Progress
- Certificate

NOTE: This file is designed to integrate with existing T21 infrastructure
(tquk_course_assignment, tquk_evidence_tracking, tquk_pdf_converter) but
is NOT a TQUK qualification. It is a professional pathway course.

Think of it as a **bridge** between raw data and useful action. A data scientist:

- Collects and organises data from different places (files, databases, APIs)
- Cleans it so it is accurate and reliable
- Explores it to find patterns and problems
- Builds models to **predict** or **classify** things
- Explains the results in simple language so managers can act on it

You can use data science in **any sector**: healthcare, finance, marketing,
e‑commerce, government, education, logistics, energy, sports and many more.
The tools and ways of thinking stay the same – only the data and business
questions change.

- **Data Scientist** – focuses on experiments and prediction.

  - Answers questions like *“Who is likely to churn?”* or
    *“What will demand look like next month?”*

- **Data Engineer** – focuses on data pipelines and infrastructure.
  - Moves data from source systems into clean, reliable tables.
  - Builds the foundations that analysts and scientists rely on.

- **Machine Learning Engineer** – focuses on deploying models.
  - Takes models and turns them into services and products.
  - Makes sure they are fast, reliable and can be monitored in production.

In a small company, one person may do several of these jobs. In a bigger
organisation, each role is usually separate.

  If we are not careful, models can repeat or even amplify that unfairness.

  how decisions that affect them are being made.

- **Accountability** – humans stay responsible for important decisions,
