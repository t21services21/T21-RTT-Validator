Data Science Foundations (Pathway 1)
Global, sector-agnostic beginner-to-junior data science programme.

This module follows the same overall structure as the TQUK modules:
- Course overview
- Learning materials
- Labs & projects
- Assessments
- Evidence tracking
- Documents
- Progress
- Certificate

NOTE: This file is designed to integrate with existing T21 infrastructure
(tquk_course_assignment, tquk_evidence_tracking, tquk_pdf_converter) but
is NOT a TQUK qualification. It is a professional pathway course.

Think of it as a **bridge** between raw data and useful action. A data scientist:

- Collects and organises data from different places (files, databases, APIs)
- Cleans it so it is accurate and reliable
- Explores it to find patterns and problems
- Builds models to **predict** or **classify** things
- Explains the results in simple language so managers can act on it

You can use data science in **any sector**: healthcare, finance, marketing,
e‑commerce, government, education, logistics, energy, sports and many more.
The tools and ways of thinking stay the same – only the data and business
questions change.

- **Data Scientist** – focuses on experiments and prediction.
  - Builds models to predict the future or classify things.
  - Answers questions like *“Who is likely to churn?”* or
    *“What will demand look like next month?”*

- **Data Engineer** – focuses on data pipelines and infrastructure.
  - Moves data from source systems into clean, reliable tables.
  - Builds the foundations that analysts and scientists rely on.

- **Machine Learning Engineer** – focuses on deploying models.
  - Takes models and turns them into services and products.
  - Makes sure they are fast, reliable and can be monitored in production.

In a small company, one person may do several of these jobs. In a bigger
organisation, each role is usually separate.

3. **Data Preparation** – Clean, join and transform the data.
4. **Modelling** – Build and compare different models.
5. **Evaluation** – Check if the model really solves the business problem.
6. **Deployment** – Put the model or analysis into real use.

work in. This course will train you to think in this structured way from the

- **Bias** – data often reflects unfair patterns from the real world.
  If we are not careful, models can repeat or even amplify that unfairness.

- **Transparency** – people should understand, at least in simple language,
  how decisions that affect them are being made.

- **Accountability** – humans stay responsible for important decisions,
  especially in areas like healthcare, justice, employment, finance and
  immigration.

As a data professional you are not just a technician. You are also a
guardian of how data and AI are used. This mindset will give you a strong,

### Getting Started

**Installation (Recommended):**
1. Download **Anaconda** (includes Python + Jupyter + 200+ packages)
2. Install from: anaconda.com/download
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook or VS Code
4. Ready to code!

**Alternative:** Google Colab (browser-based, no installation needed)

**Your First Python Script:**
```python
# This is a comment - Python ignores it
print("Hello, Data Science!")

# Calculate revenue
revenue = 150_000  # £150K (underscores for readability)
growth = 0.15      # 15% growth
next_year = revenue * (1 + growth)

print(f"Current: £{revenue:,}")
print(f"Next year: £{next_year:,.0f}")
```

**Output:**
```
Hello, Data Science!
Current: £150,000
Next year: £172,500
```

**You're already doing real calculations!**

        st.markdown(
            """**Every piece of data has a type. Master these 5:**

---

**1. Numbers (int and float)**

```python
# Integers (whole numbers)
customer_count = 1_250
new_customers = 15

# Floats (decimals)
avg_order_value = 45.99
conversion_rate = 0.032  # 3.2%

# Arithmetic
total = customer_count + new_customers  # 1265

# Division types
print(10 / 3)   # 3.3333... (float)
print(10 // 3)  # 3 (integer division)
print(10 % 3)   # 1 (remainder/modulo)

# Rounding
price = 19.99
print(round(price))      # 20
print(round(price, 1))   # 20.0
```

---

**2. Strings (text)**

```python
# Create strings
customer_name = "John Smith"
product = 'Widget Pro'  # Single or double quotes

# String operations
email = customer_name.lower().replace(" ", ".") + "@company.com"
print(email)  # john.smith@company.com

# String methods
name.upper()          # JOHN SMITH
name.split()          # ['John', 'Smith']
name.startswith("J")  # True

# F-strings for formatting (Python 3.6+)
revenue = 1_500_000
print(f"Revenue: £{revenue:,}")           # £1,500,000
print(f"Revenue: £{revenue/1000:.1f}K")   # £1500.0K
```

**Common String Operations:**
- `text.strip()` - Remove spaces
- `text.split()` - Split into words
- `",".join(['a','b'])` - Join: "a,b"
- `"test" in text` - Check substring
- `len(text)` - Count characters

---

**3. Lists (ordered collections)**

```python
# Create lists
monthly_sales = [45_000, 52_000, 48_000, 61_000]
products = ["Widget", "Gadget", "Doohickey"]

# Access by index (starts at 0!)
first = monthly_sales[0]   # 45000
last = monthly_sales[-1]   # 61000 (negative = from end)

# Slicing (get range)
q1 = monthly_sales[0:3]    # [45000, 52000, 48000]
last_two = monthly_sales[-2:]  # [48000, 61000]

# Modify
monthly_sales.append(55_000)     # Add to end
monthly_sales.insert(0, 40_000)  # Insert at position
monthly_sales.remove(48_000)     # Remove value
monthly_sales.pop()              # Remove last

# Useful operations
total = sum(monthly_sales)
average = total / len(monthly_sales)
maximum = max(monthly_sales)
minimum = min(monthly_sales)
```

**List Comprehensions (Pythonic!):**
```python
# Traditional loop
squared = []
for num in [1, 2, 3, 4]:
    squared.append(num ** 2)

# List comprehension (same result, one line)
squared = [num ** 2 for num in [1, 2, 3, 4]]  # [1, 4, 9, 16]

# With condition
revenues = [45_000, 152_000, 38_000, 201_000]
big_deals = [r for r in revenues if r > 100_000]  # [152000, 201000]
```

---

**4. Dictionaries (key-value pairs)**

```python
# Create dictionary
customer = {
    "id": "C001",
    "name": "Acme Corporation",
    "revenue": 2_500_000,
    "industry": "Retail",
    "country": "UK"
}

# Access values
print(customer["name"])  # Acme Corporation
print(customer.get("email", "unknown@example.com"))  # Safe with default

# Modify
customer["revenue"] = 2_750_000           # Update
customer["email"] = "contact@acme.com"    # Add new

# Operations
keys = customer.keys()      # All keys
values = customer.values()  # All values
items = customer.items()    # (key, value) pairs

# Check if key exists
if "email" in customer:
    print(customer["email"])
```

**Real Example: Customer Database**
```python
customers = [
    {"id": "C001", "name": "Acme", "revenue": 2_500_000},
    {"id": "C002", "name": "Tech Ltd", "revenue": 150_000},
    {"id": "C003", "name": "Global Inc", "revenue": 4_000_000}
]

# Total revenue
total = sum(c["revenue"] for c in customers)
print(f"Total: £{total:,}")  # £6,650,000

# High-value customers
enterprise = [c for c in customers if c["revenue"] > 1_000_000]
print(f"Enterprise: {len(enterprise)}")  # 2
```

---

**5. Booleans (True/False)**

```python
is_active = True
has_email = False

# Comparisons return booleans
revenue = 150_000
is_enterprise = revenue > 1_000_000  # False

# Logical operators
is_qualified = is_active and has_email    # False (both must be True)
needs_followup = not has_email            # True (inverse)
is_target = is_active or has_email        # True (at least one)

    return "Not Qualified"

status = qualify_lead(750_000, "Tech", "UK")
print(status)  # High Priority

---

**For Loops: Repeat Actions**

```python
# Loop through list
revenues = [45_000, 152_000, 38_000, 201_000]
for revenue in revenues:
    segment = categorize_customer(revenue)

# Loop with index
for i, revenue in enumerate(revenues):
    print(f"Customer {i+1}: £{revenue:,}")

# Loop through range
for month in range(1, 13):  # 1 to 12
    print(f"Month {month}")

# Loop through dictionary
customer = {"name": "Acme", "revenue": 1_500_000}
for key, value in customer.items():
    print(f"{key}: {value}")
```

---

**While Loops: Repeat Until Condition**

```python
# Calculate years to reach target
revenue = 100_000
target = 1_000_000
growth = 0.15
years = 0

while revenue < target:
    revenue *= (1 + growth)
    years += 1

# Variables/functions: snake_case ✅
customer_revenue = 150_000
def calculate_churn_rate():
    pass

# Constants: UPPERCASE ✅
MAX_RETRIES = 3
DEFAULT_TIMEOUT = 30

# Avoid ❌
x = 150000                # Not descriptive
CustomerRevenue = 150000  # Wrong case
calculate-churn = 0.15    # Can't use hyphens
```

---

**2. When to Comment**

```python
# GOOD: Explain WHY ✅
churn = calculate_churn_rate(customers, churned)
# Using 30-day window because 7-day is too volatile

# BAD: Obvious ❌
revenue = price * quantity  # Calculate revenue (DUH!)

# GOOD: Complex logic ✅
# Apply 15% for enterprise, 5% for mid-market
if segment == "Enterprise":
    discount = 0.15
elif segment == "Mid-Market":
    discount = 0.05

**3. Error Handling**

# Without (crashes if zero) ❌

    return churned / total

# With error handling ✅
def churn_rate(total, churned):
    try:

**4. Code Organization**

| Memory usage | High | Low | Medium |

**What They Do:**

**NumPy:**
- Fast numerical arrays (C-speed in Python)
- Mathematical operations
- Foundation for Pandas

**Pandas:**
- DataFrames (like Excel tables, but millions of rows)
- Load data from files/databases
- Clean, filter, transform, analyze
- The #1 tool for data analysts and scientists globally

**Together:** Handle datasets from 100 rows to 100 million rows efficiently.

print(filtered)
```

**Part C: Creating New Columns (15 min)**

```python
# Calculate total per order
df['total'] = df['price'] * df['quantity']

# Convert date to datetime
df['date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['date'])

# 2. Calculate metrics
clean_df['revenue_per_char'] = clean_df['revenue'] / clean_df['name'].str.len()

# 3. Create binary flags
clean_df['is_high_value'] = clean_df['revenue'] > 1000

# 4. Extract name components
clean_df['first_name'] = clean_df['name'].str.split().str[0]
clean_df['last_name'] = clean_df['name'].str.split().str[-1]

# Display transformed data
print("\\nTransformed data:")

**Where Data Actually Lives:**
- **Production databases:** Customer data, transactions, logs
- **Data warehouses:** Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift
- **Analytics platforms:** Most BI tools query databases, not CSV files
- **90% of data jobs require SQL** (UK, US, globally)

**Why Not Just Use Pandas?**

| Task | SQL | Pandas |
|------|-----|--------|
| Query 1B rows | ✅ Fast | ❌ Runs out of memory |
| Filter at source | ✅ Efficient | ❌ Loads everything first |
| Share with analysts | ✅ Everyone knows SQL | ❌ Need Python |
| Power BI/Tableau | ✅ Direct connection | ❌ Need exports |
| Join 5 tables | ✅ Optimized | ❌ Multiple merges |

**The Winning Combo:**
1. **SQL:** Extract and aggregate data from database
2. **Pandas:** Further analysis and modeling
3. **Together:** Best of both worlds

### Database Basics

**Relational Database = Collection of Tables**

**Example E-Commerce Database:**

**customers** table:
```
customer_id | name          | country | signup_date
------------|---------------|---------|-------------
1           | Acme Corp     | UK      | 2023-01-15
2           | Tech Ltd      | US      | 2023-02-20
3           | Global Inc    | Germany | 2023-03-10
```

**orders** table:
```
order_id | customer_id | order_date  | amount
---------|-------------|-------------|--------
101      | 1           | 2024-01-10  | 1000
102      | 1           | 2024-02-15  | 1500
103      | 2           | 2024-01-20  | 2000
104      | 3           | 2024-03-05  | 500
```

**Relationships:**
- One customer → Many orders (one-to-many)
- `customer_id` connects the tables (foreign key)

**Primary Key:** Unique identifier (customer_id, order_id)  
**Foreign Key:** Reference to another table (customer_id in orders)

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Sample data: Daily website visitors
visitors = [120, 150, 145, 300, 135, 142, 155, 148, 152, 141]

# Mean (average)
mean_visitors = np.mean(visitors)  # 158.8

# Median (middle value when sorted)
median_visitors = np.median(visitors)  # 146.5

# Mode (most common value)
from scipy import stats
mode_visitors = stats.mode(visitors)  # May have multiple modes
```

**When to Use Each:**
- **Mean:** Good for normal distributions, sensitive to outliers
- **Median:** Better when data has outliers (e.g., income, house prices)
- **Mode:** Categorical data (most popular product, common complaint)

**Example:** Daily visitors = [120, 150, 145, **2000**, 135, 142]
- Mean = 448.7 (distorted by outlier!)
- Median = 145 (robust to outlier) ✅

---

**Measures of Spread (How Scattered is the Data?)**

```python
# Range
data_range = max(visitors) - min(visitors)  # 180

# Variance (average squared distance from mean)
variance = np.var(visitors)  # 2356.6

# Standard Deviation (sqrt of variance, same units as data)
std_dev = np.std(visitors)  # 48.5

# Interquartile Range (IQR - middle 50%)
q1 = np.percentile(visitors, 25)  # 25th percentile
q3 = np.percentile(visitors, 75)  # 75th percentile
iqr = q3 - q1
```

**Interpretation:**
- **Low std dev:** Data clustered near mean (consistent)
- **High std dev:** Data spread out (variable)

**Example:**
- Store A sales: Mean=£1000, Std=£50 (consistent) ✅
- Store B sales: Mean=£1000, Std=£500 (unpredictable) ⚠️

**Skewed Distributions**

**Right-Skewed (Positive Skew):**
- Long tail on the right
- Mean > Median
- **Examples:** Income, house prices, website response time
- **Why:** Few extremely high values pull mean up

- **r = 0:** No relationship
- **r = -1:** Perfect negative (price ↑, sales ↓)

**Common Ranges:**
- 0.0 to 0.3: Weak
- 0.3 to 0.7: Moderate
- 0.7 to 1.0: Strong

**Correlation ≠ Causation!**

**Example:**
- Ice cream sales and drowning deaths are correlated
- **Does ice cream cause drowning?** NO!
- **Confounding variable:** Summer (hot weather)
  - Hot weather → more ice cream sales
  - Hot weather → more swimming → more drownings

**Before claiming causation:**
1. Check for confounding variables
2. Consider reverse causation (does Y cause X?)
3. Ideally, run controlled experiment (A/B test)

- **Positive:** Points trend upward
- **Negative:** Points trend downward
- **No correlation:** Random scatter

- **H₀:** New homepage conversion = Old homepage conversion
- **H₁:** New homepage conversion > Old homepage conversion

treatment: 1000 visitors, 160 conversions (16%)
# p-value = 0.001 (significant!)

**Lesson:** Larger samples = more reliable results

---

**2. Stopping Test Too Early (Peeking)**

**Wrong:**
- Run test for 3 days
- See p < 0.05
- Stop early and declare winner

**Problem:** Random variation can cause early false positives

**Right:**
- Calculate required sample size upfront
- Run until target reached
- Analyze once at end

---

**3. Multiple Testing (P-Hacking)**

**Wrong:**
- Test 20 different metrics
- Find 1 with p < 0.05
- Declare success

**Problem:** Testing 20 metrics, 1 will be "significant" by chance!

**Right:**
- Pick ONE primary metric before starting
- Other metrics are secondary (informational only)

---

**4. Ignoring Practical Significance**

**Example:**
- Control: 10.00% conversion
- Treatment: 10.05% conversion
- p-value: 0.03 (statistically significant)

**But:** Is 0.05% improvement worth the engineering effort?

**Consider:**
- **Statistical significance:** Is difference real?
- **Practical significance:** Is difference meaningful?

**5. Not Accounting for Seasonality**

**Wrong:**
- Run A during Christmas shopping season
- Run B in January

**Right:**
- Run A and B simultaneously
- Randomize users to each group

        st.markdown(
            """**1. Clear Titles and Labels**

```python
# ❌ BAD
plt.plot(x, y)
plt.show()

# ✅ GOOD
plt.plot(x, y)
plt.title('Monthly Revenue Increased 23% Year-over-Year', fontsize=14, fontweight='bold')
plt.xlabel('Month', fontsize=12)
plt.ylabel('Revenue (£)', fontsize=12)
plt.show()
```

**Title should answer:** "What does this chart show?"

---

**2. Use Color Purposefully**

```python
# ❌ BAD: Rainbow colors (no meaning)
colors = ['red', 'blue', 'green', 'yellow', 'purple']

# ✅ GOOD: Color highlights key insight
colors = ['gray', 'gray', 'red', 'gray', 'gray']  # Highlight worst performer
```

**Rules:**
- **One color:** For simple charts
- **Sequential (light→dark):** For ranking (sales: low→high)
- **Diverging (red→white→blue):** For positive/negative (profit/loss)
- **Categorical (distinct colors):** For categories (countries)

---

**3. Remove Clutter**

```python
# ✅ GOOD: Minimal but clear
sns.set_style('whitegrid')  # Light grid
plt.grid(alpha=0.3)         # Subtle gridlines
plt.box(False)              # No box around chart
```

**Remove:**
- Heavy borders
- 3D effects (never use!)
- Unnecessary decorations
- Chart junk

---

**4. Choose Appropriate Scale**

```python
# ❌ BAD: Y-axis starts at 50 (exaggerates differences)
plt.ylim(50, 60)

# ✅ GOOD: Y-axis starts at 0 (shows true scale)
plt.ylim(0, 100)
```

**Exception:** When all values are in a narrow range (99.1%, 99.3%, 99.5%), starting at 0 hides differences.

---

**5. Limit Categories**

```python
# ❌ BAD: 30 countries in one bar chart (unreadable)

# ✅ GOOD: Top 10 + "Other"
top10 = df.nlargest(10, 'revenue')
other = df.nsmallest(len(df)-10, 'revenue')['revenue'].sum()
```

**Max categories:**
- Bar chart: 10-15
- Pie chart: 5 (seriously, just 5!)
- Line chart: 5-7 lines

**1. Context (Why should I care?)**
- What's the business problem?
- Why does it matter?
- What's at stake?

**Example:** "Customer churn increased 15% last quarter, costing £200K in lost revenue."

---

**2. Insight (What did you find?)**
- Show data/chart
- Highlight key finding
- Use annotations

**Example:** "Analysis shows 80% of churned customers had support tickets unresolved >7 days."

**3. Action (What should we do?)**
- Clear recommendation
- Expected impact
- Next steps

**Example:** "Implement 3-day SLA for support tickets. Expected impact: Reduce churn by 5% (£70K/quarter)."

**Problem:** Can't compare angles accurately

**Solution:** Use horizontal bar chart instead

---

**2. Dual Y-Axes with Different Scales**

**Problem:** Makes correlations look stronger than they are

**Solution:** Use two separate charts or normalize to same scale

---

**3. 3D Charts**

**Problem:** Harder to read, no added value

**Solution:** Use 2D always (yes, always!)

---

**4. Truncated Y-Axis to Exaggerate Change**

**Problem:** 10% → 11% looks like 100% increase if Y-axis is 10-11

**Solution:** Start Y-axis at 0 (usually)

**5. Too Many Colors**

**Problem:** Rainbow charts confuse rather than clarify

**Solution:** 1-3 colors max, use color to highlight key point

---

**6. No Context**

**Problem:** Chart alone doesn't tell story

**Solution:** Add title that answers "so what?", annotate key points

## Complete Capstone Workflow (4-6 weeks)

**Choose ONE of these project paths:**

### Option 1: E-Commerce Customer Analytics

**Business Question:** "How can we reduce customer churn and increase lifetime value?"

**Week 1-2: Data Collection & Cleaning**
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Load data (use public dataset or create synthetic)
customers = pd.read_csv('customers.csv')
orders = pd.read_csv('orders.csv')

# Data cleaning checklist
# ☐ Remove duplicates
# ☐ Handle missing values  
# ☐ Standardize formats (dates, names, currencies)
# ☐ Create customer_id index
# ☐ Merge datasets

# Save clean version
clean_data = customers.merge(orders, on='customer_id', how='left')
clean_data.to_csv('clean_customer_data.csv', index=False)
```

**Week 3: Analysis**
```python
# RFM Segmentation
from datetime import datetime

analysis_date = pd.to_datetime('2024-12-01')
rfm = clean_data.groupby('customer_id').agg({
    'order_date': lambda x: (analysis_date - x.max()).days,
    'order_id': 'count',
    'revenue': 'sum'
}).rename(columns={'order_date': 'recency', 'order_id': 'frequency', 'revenue': 'monetary'})

# Score and segment
rfm['segment'] = 'Standard'
rfm.loc[(rfm['recency'] < 30) & (rfm['monetary'] > 1000), 'segment'] = 'Champions'
rfm.loc[(rfm['recency'] > 90), 'segment'] = 'At Risk'

# Calculate metrics
churn_rate = (rfm['segment'] == 'At Risk').sum() / len(rfm) * 100
print(f"Churn Risk: {churn_rate:.1f}%")
```

**Week 4: Visualization & Reporting**
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create dashboard
fig, axes = plt.subplots(2, 2, figsize=(14, 10))

# Segment distribution
rfm['segment'].value_counts().plot(kind='bar', ax=axes[0,0], color='#3498db')
axes[0,0].set_title('Customer Segments')

# Revenue by segment
rfm.groupby('segment')['monetary'].sum().plot(kind='bar', ax=axes[0,1], color='#e67e22')
axes[0,1].set_title('Revenue by Segment')

# Recency distribution
rfm['recency'].hist(bins=30, ax=axes[1,0], color='#2ecc71')
axes[1,0].set_title('Days Since Last Purchase')

# Frequency vs Monetary
axes[1,1].scatter(rfm['frequency'], rfm['monetary'], alpha=0.5)
axes[1,1].set_xlabel('Frequency')
axes[1,1].set_ylabel('Monetary Value')
axes[1,1].set_title('Frequency vs Revenue')

plt.tight_layout()
plt.savefig('customer_analysis_dashboard.png', dpi=300)
```

### Option 2: A/B Test Analysis

**Business Question:** "Should we launch the new website design?"

**Complete Analysis Template:**

```python
# Load test results
df = pd.read_csv('ab_test_results.csv')

# 1. Sample Ratio Check
print("Sample sizes:")
print(df.groupby('variant').size())

# 2. Conversion rates
conversion_rates = df.groupby('variant')['converted'].mean()
print(f"\\nControl: {conversion_rates['control']:.2%}")
print(f"Treatment: {conversion_rates['treatment']:.2%}")

# 3. Statistical test
from scipy.stats import chi2_contingency

contingency_table = pd.crosstab(df['variant'], df['converted'])
chi2, p_value, dof, expected = chi2_contingency(contingency_table)

print(f"\\nP-value: {p_value:.4f}")
if p_value < 0.05:
    print("✅ SIGNIFICANT - Launch new design!")
else:
    print("❌ NOT SIGNIFICANT - Keep testing")

# 4. Business impact
lift = (conversion_rates['treatment'] - conversion_rates['control']) / conversion_rates['control']
expected_additional_conversions = lift * 10000  # Assume 10K visitors/day
print(f"\\nExpected lift: {lift:.1%}")
print(f"Additional conversions per day: ~{expected_additional_conversions:.0f}")

- `foundations_capstone/`
  - `notebooks/`
  - `data/` (small sample or synthetic data only)
  - `README.md`
- `unit_labs/`
  - `python_basics/`
  - `pandas_cleaning/`
  - `sql_exercises/`
  - `visualisation_story/`

Make sure you remove credentials and do **not** publish sensitive data.

## 3. Writing a strong README

Every portfolio project should have a README that answers:

1. What problem are you solving and why does it matter?
2. What data did you use and how did you clean it?
3. What methods and tools did you apply?
4. What are the main findings or recommendations?
5. How can someone run or reproduce your work?

## 4. Connecting portfolio to CV and LinkedIn

## 💼 TOP 50 INTERVIEW QUESTIONS

### SQL Questions (10)
1. What is the difference between WHERE and HAVING?
   ANSWER: WHERE filters rows before grouping, HAVING filters after aggregation

2. Write a query to find the top 5 customers by total spend
   ANSWER:
   ```sql
   SELECT customer_id, SUM(order_amount) as total
   FROM orders
   GROUP BY customer_id
   ORDER BY total DESC
   LIMIT 5;
   ```

3. Explain INNER JOIN vs LEFT JOIN
   ANSWER: INNER returns only matches from both tables,
   LEFT returns all from left table + matches from right

4. How do you find duplicate rows?
   ANSWER:
   ```sql
   SELECT column, COUNT(*) as count
   FROM table
   GROUP BY column
   HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
   ```

5. What is a window function? Give an example
   ANSWER: Performs calculations across table rows related to current row
   ```sql
   SELECT name, salary,
          RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) as rank
   FROM employees;
   ```

6. Write query for running total
   ```sql
   SELECT date, sales,
          SUM(sales) OVER (ORDER BY date) as running_total
   FROM daily_sales;
   ```

7. How to optimize slow queries?
   - Add indexes on columns in WHERE/JOIN
   - Avoid SELECT *, choose specific columns
   - Use EXPLAIN to analyze query plan

8. Explain GROUP BY
   - Groups rows with same values
   - Used with aggregation functions (SUM, COUNT, AVG)

9. What is a subquery?
   - Query within a query
   - Used for filtering or calculating intermediate results

10. How to handle NULL in SQL?
   - Use IS NULL / IS NOT NULL
   - Use COALESCE(column, default_value)
   - Use IFNULL or NULLIF functions

### Python/Pandas Questions (10)
11. Read CSV in Pandas: pd.read_csv('file.csv')

12. DataFrame vs Series: DataFrame is 2D table, Series is 1D column

13. Handle missing values:
    - df.dropna() - remove rows
    - df.fillna(value) - fill with value
    - df.interpolate() - fill with interpolation

14. .loc vs .iloc:
    - .loc[row_label, col_label] - by label
    - .iloc[row_index, col_index] - by integer position

15. Merge DataFrames:
    pd.merge(df1, df2, on='key', how='inner')

16. groupby() example:
    df.groupby('category')['sales'].sum()

17. Remove duplicates:
    df.drop_duplicates(subset=['column'])

18. Vectorization:
    - Apply operations to entire arrays at once
    - Much faster than loops
    - Example: df['total'] = df['price'] * df['quantity']

19. Create pivot table:
    df.pivot_table(values='sales', index='product', columns='month', aggfunc='sum')

20. Filter rows:
    df[df['sales'] > 1000]
    df.query('sales > 1000 and region == "UK"')

### Statistics Questions (10)
21. Mean vs Median vs Mode:
    - Mean: average
    - Median: middle value
    - Mode: most common value

22. Standard deviation: measures spread of data around mean

23. Correlation vs Causation:
    - Correlation: two variables move together
    - Causation: one causes the other
    - Correlation does NOT imply causation!

24. P-value: probability of seeing results if null hypothesis is true
    - p < 0.05 usually considered significant

25. A/B test steps:
    - Define metric and hypothesis
    - Randomly split users
    - Run experiment
    - Calculate statistical significance
    - Make decision

26. Sampling bias: when sample doesn't represent population

27. Confidence interval: range where true value likely falls
    - 95% CI means 95% confident true value is in range

28. Hypothesis testing:
    - Null hypothesis: no effect
    - Alternative: there is an effect
    - Use statistical test to accept/reject

29. Type I error: False positive (reject true null hypothesis)
    Type II error: False negative (fail to reject false null hypothesis)

30. Outliers:
    - Values far from others
    - Handle by: removal, capping, transformation, or keeping with justification

### Machine Learning Questions (10)
31. Supervised vs Unsupervised:
    - Supervised: has labels (classification, regression)
    - Unsupervised: no labels (clustering)

32. Overfitting:
    - Model learns training data too well
    - Prevent: cross-validation, regularization, more data

33. Train/test split: divide data for training and evaluation

34. Cross-validation: multiple train/test splits to robust evaluation

35. Precision vs Recall:
    - Precision: of predicted positives, how many correct?
    - Recall: of actual positives, how many found?

36. Feature engineering: creating new features from existing data

37. Bias-variance tradeoff:
    - High bias: underfitting
    - High variance: overfitting
    - Need balance

38. Regularization (L1/L2): prevents overfitting by penalizing complexity

39. Imbalanced datasets:
    - Use SMOTE, class weights, or different metrics
    - Don't use accuracy alone

40. Model evaluation:
    - Regression: MSE, RMSE, MAE, R²
    - Classification: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, ROC-AUC

### Behavioral Questions (10)
41. Tell me about yourself:
    - Brief career history
    - Why data role
    - Key skills and achievements

42. Why data analyst/scientist?
    - Passion for data and insights
    - Problem-solving
    - Impact on business decisions

43. Describe a challenging project:

    - Focus on how you overcame challenges

44. How do you prioritize tasks?
    - Understand business impact
    - Consider urgency and importance
    - Communicate with stakeholders

45. Explain technical results to non-technical audience:
