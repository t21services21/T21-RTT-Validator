# 🚨 QUICK FIX - TQUK ACCESS ISSUE

## **THE PROBLEM:**
The code changes haven't deployed to Streamlit Cloud yet, so you're still seeing "You are not enrolled."

## **IMMEDIATE SOLUTION:**

### **Option 1: Manually Reboot App on Streamlit Cloud**

1. Go to: https://share.streamlit.io/
2. Log in
3. Find: t21-healthcare-platform
4. Click the "⋮" (three dots)
5. Click: "Reboot app"
6. Wait 30 seconds
7. Refresh your browser
8. Should work now!

### **Option 2: Enroll Yourself Temporarily**

While waiting for deployment:

1. Go to: 👨‍🏫 Teaching & Assessment
2. Click: "📚 TQUK Course Assignment" tab
3. Select:
   - Student: Your email
   - Course: Level 3 Adult Care
4. Click: "Assign Course"
5. Go back to: 📚 Level 3 Adult Care
6. Now you can access it!

### **Option 3: Check GitHub**

1. Go to: https://github.com/your-username/T21-RTT-Validator
2. Check if latest commits are there
3. If not, the push didn't work
4. Use VS Code to push manually

## **WHY THIS IS HAPPENING:**

The git push command failed because PowerShell can't find git.exe

The changes are on your local computer but not on GitHub/Streamlit Cloud yet.

## **PERMANENT FIX:**

Use VS Code or GitHub Desktop to push changes instead of command line.

## **FILES THAT NEED TO BE PUSHED:**

- tquk_course_assignment.py (Supabase import fix)
- tquk_level3_adult_care_module.py (Admin access + materials viewer)
- tquk_it_user_skills_module.py (Admin access)
- tquk_customer_service_module.py (Admin access)
- tquk_business_admin_module.py (Admin access)

## **VERIFICATION:**

After pushing, check:
1. GitHub shows latest commits
2. Streamlit Cloud shows "Deploying..."
3. Wait 2-3 minutes
4. Refresh browser
5. Should see "👨‍💼 Admin/Staff View" message instead of "You are not enrolled"
