### 3. Multiplying and Dividing by 10, 100, 1000

**The Rules:**

**Multiplying:**
- × 10: Move decimal point 1 place right
- × 100: Move decimal point 2 places right
- × 1000: Move decimal point 3 places right

**Examples:**
- 45 × 10 = 450
- 45 × 100 = 4,500
- 45 × 1000 = 45,000
- 3.5 × 10 = 35
- 3.5 × 100 = 350

**Dividing:**
- ÷ 10: Move decimal point 1 place left
- ÷ 100: Move decimal point 2 places left
- ÷ 1000: Move decimal point 3 places left

**Examples:**
- 450 ÷ 10 = 45
- 450 ÷ 100 = 4.5
- 450 ÷ 1000 = 0.45

**Practice:**
1. 67 × 100 = ?

- Change = Amount Paid - Total Cost
- Profit = Selling Price - Cost Price

**Example Problem:**
*A shop sells pens at £2 each. What is the cost of 5 pens?*

Formula: Cost = Price × Quantity
Cost = £2 × 5 = £10

**Practice:**
1. Distance = Speed × Time. Find distance if speed = 30mph and time = 2 hours.
