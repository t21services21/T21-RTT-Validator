# BROKEN FEATURES - SYSTEMATIC FIX

## üîç WHAT DOESN'T WORK (30% broken):

### 1. AI Tutor (`pages/ai_tutor_system.py`)
**Problem:** Needs OpenAI API key, no fallback
**Fix:** Add intelligent fallback responses

### 2. Job Board (`pages/job_board.py`)
**Problem:** Apply/Save buttons don't actually do anything
**Fix:** Make buttons save to session state and show confirmation

### 3. Hands-On Lab System (`pages/hands_on_lab_system.py`)
**Problem:** Terminal doesn't execute commands
**Fix:** Add command simulation and responses

### 4. Tool Practice Arena (`pages/tool_practice_arena.py`)
**Problem:** Only 5 tools have content, others empty
**Fix:** Add content for all 25 tools

### 5. SOC Training Portal
**Problem:** Quiz results don't save
**Fix:** Save to session state

### 6. Cyber Lab
**Problem:** Some labs still show "Loading..."
**Fix:** Already mostly fixed, just need final touches
