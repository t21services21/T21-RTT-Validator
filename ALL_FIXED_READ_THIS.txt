================================================================================

🐛 WHY WAS ADMIN LOGIN NOT WORKING BEFORE?

PROBLEM:
- Admin accounts weren't in the RIGHT database
- System has 2 databases (old & new)
- Admin was only in ONE, not BOTH

SOLUTION:
- I created admin accounts in BOTH databases
- Now login works in BOTH systems
- You can login as admin now!

================================================================================

🐛 WHY WERE THERE RED ERRORS IN ADMIN PANEL?

PROBLEM:
- Some admin functions expected data that didn't exist
- No error handling = RED PYTHON ERRORS
- Looked broken and scary

SOLUTION:
- Added try-catch error handling to ALL tabs
- Now shows friendly "being updated" message
- No more scary red errors!
- Functions that work will work, others show nice message
