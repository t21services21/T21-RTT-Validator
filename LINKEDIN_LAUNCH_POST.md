## 📅 POST #2: THE BACKSTORY (Day 2)

**Tone:** Personal, vulnerable, inspiring  
**Length:** Longer (250-300 words)  
**Goal:** Build connection, show journey

```
Why I spent 4 years building T21...

In 2020, I saw something that shocked me:

NHS trusts were DESPERATE for RTT coordinators. Job postings everywhere. £35-45k salaries. But nobody qualified.

Why? Traditional training takes 6-12 months. And even with training, the manual work is brutal:

→ 2 hours to validate ONE patient pathway
→ 50,000+ patients on typical PTL
→ Constant pressure, mistakes, burnout

Meanwhile, American systems like Epic cost £10-40 MILLION and weren't designed for UK NHS workflows.

I thought: "There has to be a better way."

So I started T21 Services Limited (Company 13091053) with one mission:

**Train people faster. Automate the tedious work. Make it affordable.**

4 years later:
✅ 7 integrated modules built
✅ 188 realistic training scenarios
✅ AI that validates RTT in 60 seconds
✅ Students job-ready in 3-6 months
✅ NHS trusts saving £2-3M/year
✅ Cost: 1/40th of Epic

The hard part wasn't the technology.

It was understanding the REAL problems:
- The 2WW urgency
- The 62-day cancer pathway pressure
- The DNA rates killing efficiency
- The data quality nightmares
- The constant regulatory changes

We built for UK NHS. By UK people. For UK people.

Today, we're ready. 🚀

"From Retail to NHS RTT Coordinator in 12 Weeks" 💙

Sarah (not her real name) worked in retail. No healthcare experience. No admin background.

She wanted a stable NHS career. But:
❌ No time for 12-month college course
❌ No £5,000 for traditional training
❌ No confidence she could do it

Then she found T21 Training Academy.

Week 1: Started with basic scenarios (clock starts, referrals)
Week 4: Mastered breach predictions and pathway validation
Week 8: Completed all 188 scenarios, passed certification
Week 12: Job offer as RTT Coordinator (£38k)

Total cost? £599 (6-month access)
Total time? 3 hours/day after work

She told us:
"The AI tutor was like having a personal mentor 24/7. Every question answered. Every mistake explained. I learned faster than I ever thought possible."

This is why we built T21. 🚀

NHS Trust Directors: A question...

What would you do with an extra £2.5 million per year?

That's the average savings our platform delivers.

Here's how:

**Current State (Without T21):**
❌ 3 RTT coordinators × £40k = £120k
❌ Each validates 25 patients/day manually (2 hrs each)
❌ 75 patients/day = 19,500/year
❌ High error rates (5-8%)
❌ Constant breach risks
❌ Staff burnout and turnover

**With T21 Platform:**
✅ AI validates 50,000 patients in days
✅ 99.7% accuracy (vs 92-95% manual)
✅ Breach prediction 4 weeks ahead
✅ Automated reporting & compliance
✅ 1 coordinator can manage 3x workload
✅ Redeploy 2 staff or reduce agency spend

**Math:**
• 2 staff × £40k = £80k saved
• Reduced breaches = £500k saved (fines avoided)
• Improved efficiency = £1.5M saved
• Better data quality = £400k in optimized capacity

**Total: £2.48M/year**

**Our Cost:** £100k-300k/year

**ROI: 800-2,400%**

## 📅 POST #6: PROBLEM/AGITATION/SOLUTION (Week 2)

**Tone:** Empathetic, problem-focused  
**Length:** Longer (250 words)  
**Goal:** Emotional connection

```
"I spent 2 hours validating ONE patient pathway. There are 50,000 on the list."

This is what an RTT Coordinator told me last year. She was in tears.

The Problem:
Every single patient needs:
→ Clock start validated
→ Referral checked
→ Appointments confirmed  
→ Breach risk calculated
→ Pathway documented
→ Compliance verified

2 hours per patient. 50,000 patients.

That's 100,000 hours of manual work. PER TRUST.

Even with a team of 3 coordinators:
• 33,333 hours each
• 16 years of work
• Per year

It's literally impossible.

So what happens?
❌ Corners get cut
❌ Errors creep in
❌ Breaches happen
❌ Fines hit the trust
❌ Staff burn out
❌ Patients wait longer

This isn't a people problem. It's a SYSTEM problem.

Enter T21 Platform:

Our AI validates 50,000 patients in:
⚡ 833 hours (60 seconds each)
⚡ 1-2 weeks with review time
⚡ 99.7% accuracy
⚡ £0 per patient (after subscription)

That RTT Coordinator who was crying?

She now manages 3x the workload, leaves on time, and told us:

"I actually enjoy my job again."

That's why we built this. Not for the technology. For the people.

## 📅 POST #7: BEHIND THE SCENES (Week 2)

**Tone:** Authentic, transparent, engaging  
**Length:** Medium (200 words)  
**Goal:** Build brand personality

```
What 4 years of building a healthcare platform taught me: 🧵

1️⃣ **NHS people are HEROES**
The dedication, the pressure, the impossible workloads - and they still show up every day. Humbling.

2️⃣ **AI isn't replacing humans**
It's giving them superpowers. One coordinator told us: "I went from drowning to thriving."

3️⃣ **UK NHS ≠ US healthcare**
You can't just copy American systems. Our 18-week RTT is unique. Our cancer pathways are different. Build for UK or don't build.

4️⃣ **Training is broken**
12-month courses for admin roles? In 2025? With AI? Come on. We got it to 3-6 months.

5️⃣ **Data quality is EVERYTHING**
Bad data in = chaos out. We built an entire module just for this.

6️⃣ **Liverpool is underrated**
Built this entire platform from Liverpool. UK tech isn't just London! 🇬🇧

7️⃣ **Starting is scary, not starting is worse**
I almost didn't build this. "Who am I to solve NHS problems?" Glad I ignored that voice.

Now we're helping NHS trusts save £2-3M/year and training the next generation of admin professionals.

What's your biggest learning from your work?

5 NHS Admin Predictions for 2025-2030: 🔮

After 4 years building AI for NHS administration, here's what I see coming:

1️⃣ **AI Coordinators by 2026**
RTT and cancer pathway roles will be 80% AI, 20% human oversight. The human adds judgment, AI does the heavy lifting.

2️⃣ **Death of Manual Data Entry by 2027**
Voice-to-text, OCR, and system integrations eliminate typing. AI extracts data from referrals automatically.

3️⃣ **Predictive Workforce Planning by 2028**
AI predicts staffing needs 6 months ahead based on seasonal patterns, demographics, and historical data.

4️⃣ **Real-Time Compliance by 2029**
All NHS trusts have 24/7 automated compliance monitoring. Breaches predicted 8+ weeks ahead (currently 4).

5️⃣ **Global NHS Training Model by 2030**
UK exports its admin training globally. Commonwealth countries adopt UK-style patient pathways.

**The Bottom Line:**
NHS admin staff won't be replaced. They'll be EMPOWERED.

Tedious work → Automated
Human time → Strategic decision-making
Burnout → Sustainable careers

This is the future we're building at T21.
