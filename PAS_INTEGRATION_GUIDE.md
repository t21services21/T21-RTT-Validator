## 💰 Business Value

### Without Integration:
- "Training platform"
- £50-150/user/month
- Demo data only

### With Integration:
- "Operational platform"
- £500-1,500/user/month
- Real PAS connectivity
- **HUGE competitive advantage!**

---

## 🔧 Configuration

### Current Setup (Demo):
```python
# In fhir_integration.py
FHIR_CONFIGS = {
    "hapi_test": {
        "base_url": "http://hapi.fhir.org/baseR4",
        "auth_required": False
    }
}
```

### For NHS Trust (Production):
```python
# Add their config
FHIR_CONFIGS = {
    "trust_a": {
        "base_url": "https://trust-a.nhs.uk/fhir",
        "auth_required": True,
        "client_id": "t21services",
        "client_secret": "xxxxx"
    }
}
```

**That's it!** Change endpoint → Connected!
