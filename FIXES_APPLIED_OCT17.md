# ✅ FIXES APPLIED - OCTOBER 17, 2025 at 8:52am

## **1. ✅ PRICING TIER 4 - CORRECTED TERMINOLOGY**

### **Problem:**
- Using "job placement" or "job support" was confusing
- Need to clarify that staff applies FOR students

### **Solution:**
Updated Tier 4 (£1,799) to say:
- ✅ **"Job Application Support"**
- ✅ **"Staff applies for jobs FOR you"**
- ✅ **"We get you interviews"**

### **What It Means:**
- Staff writes and submits job applications ON BEHALF of students
- Staff gets students interviews
- NOT "job placement" (which implies placing them IN the job)
- This is application assistance, student still does interviews themselves

### **File Modified:**
- `pages/welcome.py` - Tier 4 Premium section

---

## **2. ✅ FIXED "VIEW" & "ADD MILESTONE" BUTTONS**

### **Problem:**
- Clicking "View" button did nothing
- Clicking "Add Milestone" button did nothing
- Buttons were setting session state but no UI was responding

### **Root Cause:**
Buttons were incomplete - they set flags like:
```python
st.session_state[f"viewing_{patient_id}"] = True
```

But there was NO CODE checking those flags and displaying anything!

### **Solution:**
Added complete UI logic:

**When "View" is clicked:**
1. Sets session state flag
2. Triggers `st.rerun()`
3. Expander opens showing:
   - Patient information
   - Timeline and breach status
   - All milestones
   - Close button

**When "Add Milestone" is clicked:**
1. Sets session state flag
2. Triggers `st.rerun()`
3. Expander opens showing:
   - Milestone type selector
   - Date picker
   - Description field
   - Save/Cancel buttons

### **File Modified:**
- `cancer_pathway_ui.py` - Added 80+ lines of UI logic

### **Now Works:**
- ✅ Click "View" → Patient details appear
- ✅ Click "Add Milestone" → Form appears
- ✅ Can add milestones and save
- ✅ Can close and return to list

---
