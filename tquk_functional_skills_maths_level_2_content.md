### 2. Calculations with Large Numbers

**Strategies for Checking Answers:**

**Estimation:**
- Round numbers before calculating
- 4,987 + 3,012 ≈ 5,000 + 3,000 = 8,000

**Approximation:**
- Use simpler numbers
- 49 × 51 ≈ 50 × 50 = 2,500

**Inverse Operations:**
- Check addition with subtraction
- Check multiplication with division

**Examples:**
