# ✅ TQUK-ONLY STUDENTS - NO RTT CONTENT!

## ❌ **THE PROBLEM YOU FOUND:**

TQUK student (Level 3 Adult Care only) was seeing:
- 📖 Structured Learning ❌ (RTT content)
- 🎓 Level 3 Diploma ✅
- 📚 Materials ❌ (showing "rtt codes" - RTT content!)
- 🎥 Videos ❌ (RTT videos)
- 📢 News
- 📝 Assignments ❌ (RTT assignments)
- 🎯 Practice Quizzes ❌ (RTT quizzes)

**The student was seeing RTT materials even though they're ONLY enrolled in TQUK!** ❌

---

## 🔍 **ROOT CAUSE:**

### **Problem 1: General Tabs Shown to Everyone**
The Learning Portal showed Materials, Videos, Assignments, etc. to ALL students.

### **Problem 2: No Content Filtering**
The LMS system (`lms_system.py`) loads ALL materials from database:
```python
query = supabase.table('learning_materials').select('*').eq('status', 'active')
```

**No filtering by course type!** So RTT materials ("rtt codes") appeared for TQUK students!

---

## ✅ **THE FIX:**

### **Solution: Separate TQUK and RTT Students**

**TQUK-Only Students:**
- See ONLY their course tabs (e.g., Level 3 Diploma)
- Do NOT see general tabs (Materials, Videos, Assignments)
- All content is within their course-specific tab

**RTT Students:**
- See Structured Learning (RTT content)
- See Materials, Videos, Assignments (RTT resources)
- See general tabs with RTT-specific content

**Mixed Students (TQUK + RTT):**
- See both TQUK course tabs
- See RTT general tabs
- Access both types of content

---

## 📊 **NEW LOGIC:**

```python
# Check if student has TQUK courses
if 'level3_adult_care' in enrolled_courses:
    tab_list.append("🎓 Level 3 Diploma")
    has_tquk_courses = True

# Check if student has RTT access
rtt_modules = ['🏥 Patient Administration Hub', '🏥 Clinical Workflows']
has_rtt_access = any(module in user_modules for module in rtt_modules)

# Only show general tabs if student has RTT access
if has_rtt_access:
    tab_list.extend([
        "📖 Structured Learning",
        "📚 Materials",
        "🎥 Videos",
        "📝 Assignments",
        "🎯 Practice Quizzes"
    ])
# TQUK-only students DON'T get these tabs!
```

## 🔧 **TECHNICAL DETAILS:**

### **Detection Logic:**

**Check TQUK Enrollments:**
```python
enrollments = get_learner_enrollments(user_email)
enrolled_courses = [e.get('course_id', '') for e in enrollments]
has_tquk_courses = len(enrolled_courses) > 0
```

**Check RTT Access:**
```python
user_modules = get_user_modules(user_email)
rtt_modules = ['🏥 Patient Administration Hub', '🏥 Clinical Workflows', '✅ Task Management']
has_rtt_access = any(module in user_modules for module in rtt_modules)
```

**Build Tab List:**
```python
if has_tquk_courses and not has_rtt_access:
    # TQUK-only: Show only course tabs
    tab_list = [course tabs only]
elif has_rtt_access and not has_tquk_courses:
    # RTT-only: Show RTT tabs
    tab_list = ["Structured Learning", "Materials", "Videos", ...]
elif has_tquk_courses and has_rtt_access:
    # Mixed: Show both
    tab_list = ["Structured Learning"] + [course tabs] + ["Materials", "Videos", ...]
```
