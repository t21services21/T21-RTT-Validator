**Remaining:** 84 (91.3%)  

**Estimated Time:**
- Features 1-8: 8 hours âœ… DONE

## ðŸ’¡ NEXT STEPS

Due to the massive scope (84 remaining features), I recommend:

### Option 1: Systematic Build (Recommended)
Build features in priority order over multiple sessions:
- **Session 2:** Features 9-20 (PAS, Breach, Triage) - 12 hours
- **Session 3:** Features 21-40 (Automation) - 20 hours  
- **Session 4:** Features 41-60 (Enhancements) - 20 hours
- **Session 5:** Features 61-92 (Integration) - 32 hours

### Option 2: Integrate Current 8 Features First
- Integrate 8 completed features into existing modules
- Test thoroughly
- Then continue with remaining 84

### Option 3: Continue Non-Stop
- Build all 84 remaining features now
- Will take many more hours in this session
