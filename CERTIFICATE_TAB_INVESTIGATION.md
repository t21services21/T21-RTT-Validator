# 🔍 CERTIFICATE TAB INVESTIGATION - DEEP DIVE

## ✅ **CODE VERIFICATION:**

### **Teaching & Learning Module:**
```python
# Line 176-184: Tab creation
tabs = st.tabs([
    "📚 Course Overview",      # tabs[0]
    "📖 Learning Materials",   # tabs[1]
    "🎯 Optional Units",       # tabs[2]
    "📝 Assessments",          # tabs[3]
    "📋 Evidence Tracking",    # tabs[4]
    "📥 TQUK Documents",       # tabs[5]
    "📊 My Progress",          # tabs[6]
    "🎓 Certificate"           # tabs[7] ← THIS IS THE 8TH TAB
])

# Line 468-470: Certificate tab rendering
with tabs[7]:
    # Certificate tab
    render_certificate(enrollment)
```

**✅ CODE IS CORRECT!**

## 🔍 **COMPARISON WITH OTHER MODULES:**

### **Adult Social Care (Working):**
```python
# Lines 174-182: IDENTICAL structure
tabs = st.tabs([
    "📚 Course Overview",
    "📖 Learning Materials",
    "🎯 Optional Units",
    "📝 Assessments",
    "📋 Evidence Tracking",
    "📥 TQUK Documents",
    "📊 My Progress",
    "🎓 Certificate"
])
```

**✅ EXACT SAME CODE!**

---

## 🎯 **THE ISSUE:**

Looking at your screenshot, the tabs are:
1. Course Overview ✅
2. Learning Materials ✅
3. Optional Units ✅
4. Assessments ✅
5. Evidence Tracking ✅
6. TQUK Documents ✅
7. My Progress ✅ (you're here)
8. Certificate ❌ **NOT VISIBLE**

---

## 💡 **POSSIBLE CAUSES:**

### **1. Streamlit Tab Overflow**
When there are 8 tabs, Streamlit may not show all tabs if the screen is narrow.

**Solution:** 
- Make browser window wider
- Look for horizontal scroll arrows in the tab bar
- Zoom out (Ctrl + -)

### **2. CSS/Styling Issue**
The 8th tab might be rendering but hidden by CSS.

### **3. Screen Resolution**
Your screen might not be wide enough to show all 8 tabs at once.

---

## 🔧 **SOLUTIONS TO TRY:**

### **Solution 1: Reduce Tab Names**
Make tab names shorter so all fit on screen:

```python
tabs = st.tabs([
    "📚 Overview",          # Shorter
    "📖 Materials",         # Shorter
    "🎯 Optional",          # Shorter
    "📝 Assess",            # Shorter
    "📋 Evidence",          # Shorter
    "📥 Docs",              # Shorter
    "📊 Progress",          # Shorter
    "🎓 Cert"               # Shorter
])
```

### **Solution 2: Use Expander Instead**
Put Certificate in an expander below tabs instead of as 8th tab.

### **Solution 3: Combine Tabs**
Merge "My Progress" and "Certificate" into one tab called "Progress & Certificate".

---

## 🎯 **RECOMMENDED FIX:**

**Shorten the tab names to make all 8 tabs visible!**

This is the quickest fix that will make the Certificate tab appear.

---

## ✅ **NEXT STEP:**

Should I:
1. **Shorten tab names** to make Certificate visible?
2. **Combine Progress + Certificate** into one tab?
3. **Move Certificate** to an expander below tabs?

**Which solution do you prefer?** 🚀
