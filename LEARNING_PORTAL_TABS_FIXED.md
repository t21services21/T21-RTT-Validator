# ✅ LEARNING PORTAL TABS - ENROLLMENT-BASED DISPLAY FIXED!

## ❌ **THE PROBLEM:**

Learning Portal was showing ALL course tabs to ALL students:
- 📖 Structured Learning
- 🎓 Level 3 Diploma
- 💻 IT User Skills ❌ (Student NOT enrolled!)
- 📚 Materials
- 🎥 Videos
- etc.

**Student enrolled ONLY in Level 3 Adult Care could see "IT User Skills" tab!** ❌

---

## 🔍 **ROOT CAUSE:**

### **Hardcoded Tabs:**
```python
# OLD CODE:
tabs = st.tabs([
    "📖 Structured Learning",
    "🎓 Level 3 Diploma",
    "💻 IT User Skills",  # ← Always shown!
    "📚 Materials",
    ...
])
```

**All tabs were shown to everyone, regardless of enrollment!** ❌

---

## ✅ **THE FIX:**

### **Dynamic Tabs Based on Enrollments:**

```python
# Get user's enrollments
enrollments = get_learner_enrollments(user_email)
enrolled_courses = [e.get('course_id', '') for e in enrollments]

# Build tabs based on enrollments
tab_list = ["📖 Structured Learning"]  # Always show

# Add course-specific tabs only if enrolled
if 'level3_adult_care' in enrolled_courses:
    tab_list.append("🎓 Level 3 Diploma")
if 'level2_it_skills' in enrolled_courses:
    tab_list.append("💻 IT User Skills")
if 'level2_customer_service' in enrolled_courses:
    tab_list.append("🤝 Customer Service")
if 'functional_skills_english' in enrolled_courses:
    tab_list.append("📚 Functional Skills English")
if 'functional_skills_maths' in enrolled_courses:
    tab_list.append("🔢 Functional Skills Maths")

# Add general tabs
tab_list.extend([
    "📚 Materials",
    "🎥 Videos",
    "📢 News",
    "📝 Assignments",
    "🎯 Practice Quizzes"
])

tabs = st.tabs(tab_list)
```

### **Dynamic Tab Rendering:**

```python
tab_index = 0

# Tab 0: Always Structured Learning
with tabs[tab_index]:
    render_comprehensive_learning()
tab_index += 1

# Level 3 Diploma tab (only if enrolled)
if "🎓 Level 3 Diploma" in tab_list:
    with tabs[tab_index]:
        render_level3_adult_care()
    tab_index += 1

# IT User Skills tab (only if enrolled)
if "💻 IT User Skills" in tab_list:
    with tabs[tab_index]:
        render_it_user_skills()
    tab_index += 1

# Materials tab (always shown)
with tabs[tab_index]:
    render_lms_feature("learning_materials")
tab_index += 1
```
