**Unit Code:** F/601/8315  
**GLH:** 18 hours  
**Credits:** 3  
**Level:** 3

## üìö LEARNING OUTCOMES

1. Understand what diabetes is
2. Know how to recognize signs and symptoms of diabetes
3. Understand diabetes management
4. Be able to support individuals with diabetes

## ü©∏ WHAT IS DIABETES?

Diabetes is a condition where blood glucose (sugar) levels are too high because the body can't use glucose properly.

### How It Works:

**Normal:**
1. Eat food containing carbohydrates
2. Glucose enters bloodstream
3. Pancreas produces insulin
4. Insulin allows glucose into cells for energy
5. Blood glucose stays normal (4-7 mmol/L)

**Diabetes:**
- Not enough insulin OR
- Insulin doesn't work properly
- Glucose stays in blood
- Blood glucose too high (hyperglycemia)

## üìä TYPES OF DIABETES

### Type 1 Diabetes:

**What it is:**
- Autoimmune condition
- Body attacks insulin-producing cells
- No insulin produced
- Usually develops in childhood/young adults
- 10% of people with diabetes

**Causes:**
- Genetic factors
- Environmental triggers
- NOT caused by lifestyle

**Treatment:**
- Insulin injections (essential)
- Blood glucose monitoring
- Carbohydrate counting
- Healthy lifestyle

### Type 2 Diabetes:

**What it is:**
- Body doesn't produce enough insulin OR
- Insulin doesn't work properly (insulin resistance)
- Usually develops in adults (but increasing in children)
- 90% of people with diabetes

**Risk Factors:**
- Overweight/obesity
- Family history
- Ethnicity (South Asian, African Caribbean, Black African)
- Age over 40 (or 25 for high-risk groups)
- Sedentary lifestyle

**Treatment:**
- Lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, weight loss)
- Tablets (metformin, gliclazide, etc.)
- Sometimes insulin
- Blood glucose monitoring

### Gestational Diabetes:

**What it is:**
- Develops during pregnancy
- Usually resolves after birth
- Increases risk of Type 2 later

### Pre-Diabetes:

**What it is:**
- Blood glucose higher than normal but not diabetes yet
- Warning sign
- Can be reversed with lifestyle changes

## üö® SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

### Hyperglycemia (High Blood Sugar):

**Symptoms:**
- Increased thirst
- Frequent urination (especially at night)
- Tiredness
- Blurred vision
- Weight loss (Type 1)
- Slow healing wounds
- Recurrent infections (thrush, UTIs)

**Long-term if Untreated:**
- Damage to eyes, kidneys, nerves, heart
- Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) - Type 1
- Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS) - Type 2

### Hypoglycemia (Low Blood Sugar - Hypo):

**Causes:**
- Too much insulin/medication
- Missed or delayed meal
- More exercise than usual
- Alcohol

**Symptoms:**
- Shaking, trembling
- Sweating
- Hunger
- Confusion
- Irritability
- Pale
- Fast heartbeat
- Weakness

**Severe:**
- Unconscious
- Seizures
- Medical emergency

**Treatment:**
1. Fast-acting carbs (glucose tablets, sugary drink, sweets)
2. Wait 15 minutes
3. Retest blood glucose
4. If still low, repeat
5. Once above 4 mmol/L, eat slow-acting carbs (sandwich, biscuits)

## üíä DIABETES MANAGEMENT

### Blood Glucose Monitoring:

**Methods:**
- Finger-prick test
- Continuous glucose monitor (CGM)
- Flash glucose monitor (FreeStyle Libre)

**Target Ranges:**
- Before meals: 4-7 mmol/L
- 2 hours after meals: under 8.5 mmol/L
- Bedtime: 5-7 mmol/L

**HbA1c:**
- Average blood glucose over 3 months
- Target usually under 48 mmol/mol (6.5%)
- Checked every 3-6 months

### Medication:

**Type 1:**
- Insulin (essential)
- Multiple daily injections OR insulin pump
- Types: rapid-acting, short-acting, intermediate, long-acting

**Type 2:**
- Metformin (first-line)
- Sulphonylureas (gliclazide)
- DPP-4 inhibitors
- SGLT2 inhibitors
- GLP-1 agonists
- Insulin (if needed)

### Diet:

**Principles:**
- Regular meals
- Carbohydrate awareness
- Healthy carbs (wholegrain, low GI)
- Limit sugar
- Plenty of vegetables
- Lean protein
- Healthy fats
- Limit salt

**Carbohydrate Counting:**
- Know carb content of foods
- Match insulin to carbs (Type 1)
- Consistent carbs (Type 2)

### Exercise:

**Benefits:**
- Lowers blood glucose
- Improves insulin sensitivity
- Weight management
- Cardiovascular health

**Considerations:**
- Check blood glucose before/after
- May need extra carbs
- Adjust medication
- Stay hydrated
- Carry hypo treatment

### Foot Care:

**Why Important:**
- Diabetes can damage nerves (neuropathy)
- Reduced sensation
- Poor circulation
- Wounds heal slowly
- Risk of infection, amputation

**Daily Foot Care:**
‚úÖ Check feet daily  
‚úÖ Wash and dry carefully  
‚úÖ Moisturize (not between toes)  
‚úÖ Trim nails straight across  
‚úÖ Wear well-fitting shoes  
‚úÖ Never walk barefoot  
‚úÖ Report any problems immediately  

**Annual Foot Check:**
- By podiatrist or diabetes nurse
- Check sensation, circulation, skin
- Risk assessment

## üè• COMPLICATIONS
