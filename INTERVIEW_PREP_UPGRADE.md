Situation: Where were you? What happened?

Action: What did YOU do? (Use "I" not "we")
Result: What was the outcome? Use numbers!
```

**Example for Healthcare Assistant:**
```
Q: How would you support a patient who is anxious?

A: "I would first acknowledge their feelings and show empathy. 
I'd speak in a calm, reassuring tone and explain what's happening 
step-by-step. I'd give them time to express concerns and listen 
actively. If needed, I'd involve the nurse or their family 
for additional support. Throughout, I'd maintain dignity and 
respect, and follow the person-centered care approach."

TIPS:
- Show empathy first
- Mention communication skills
- Reference person-centered care
- Show you'd escalate if needed
```
