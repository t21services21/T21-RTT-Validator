## 🚀 **HOW TO INTEGRATE INTO YOUR PLATFORM**

### **STEP 1: Add to App.py Sidebar**

In `app.py`, add notification and message badges:

```python
# At the top of app.py, after imports
from notification_ui import render_notification_badge, check_and_show_new_notifications
from messaging_ui import render_message_badge_sidebar

# In sidebar section (around line 1250)
if st.session_state.user_license:
    # Existing user profile code...
    
    # ADD THESE LINES:
    render_notification_badge()  # Shows notification count
    render_message_badge_sidebar()  # Shows message count
    check_and_show_new_notifications()  # Shows pop-ups for urgent items
```

---

### **STEP 2: Add Pages to Navigation**

In `accessible_modules` list:

```python
accessible_modules = [
    "🏥 Patient Administration Hub",
    "🎓 Learning Portal",
    "👨‍🏫 Teaching & Assessment",
    "🔒 Information Governance",
    
    # ADD THESE:
    "🔔 Notifications",  # NEW!
    "💬 Messages",  # NEW!
    "📝 My Requests",  # NEW! (for students)
    
    "💼 Career Development",
    "⚙️ Administration",
]
```

---

### **STEP 3: Add Render Blocks**

In `app.py`, add these elif blocks:

```python
elif tool == "🔔 Notifications":
    from notification_ui import render_notification_center
    render_notification_center()

elif tool == "💬 Messages":
    from messaging_ui import render_messaging_system
    render_messaging_system()

elif tool == "📝 My Requests":
    from approval_ui import render_user_request_page
    render_user_request_page()
```

---

### **STEP 4: Update Admin Panel**

In the Admin Panel section, add Approval Dashboard:

```python
# In Admin Panel tabs, add:
admin_tab11 = st.tabs([
    "👥 User Management",
    # ... existing tabs ...
    "✅ Approvals"  # NEW!
])

with admin_tab11:
    from approval_ui import render_admin_approval_dashboard
    render_admin_approval_dashboard()
```
