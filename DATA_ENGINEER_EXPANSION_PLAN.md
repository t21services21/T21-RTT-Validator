## PRIORITY LABS TO ADD:

### HIGH PRIORITY (Must Have):
1. Delta Lake with Spark
2. Airflow complex DAGs
3. GCP/Azure examples
4. Data quality framework
5. Detailed capstone projects

### MEDIUM PRIORITY (Should Have):
1. Kafka Connect
2. Stream processing joins
3. CI/CD pipelines
4. Monitoring dashboards
5. Cost optimization

### NICE TO HAVE:
1. Data vault modeling
2. Multi-cloud patterns

## NEXT SESSION PLAN:

1. Add 2-3 labs to Units 3, 4, 5, 6
2. Expand Unit 7 capstone to 5 projects
3. Add Docker/Kubernetes examples
4. Add monitoring & observability code
5. Target: 7,500-8,000 total lines

This will bring platform to ~38,000 total lines!
