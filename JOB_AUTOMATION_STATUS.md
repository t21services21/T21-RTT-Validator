## ⚠️ **WHAT NEEDS WORK:**

### **1. Live NHS Jobs Scraping** ⚠️

**Problem:** Scraper finds 0 jobs from NHS Jobs website

**Attempted Solutions:**
1. ❌ HTML scraping - blocked or wrong selectors
2. ❌ API endpoint - may require authentication

**Options to Fix:**

**Option A: Apply for Official NHS Jobs API** (RECOMMENDED)
- Contact: NHS Jobs API team
- Request: API access for student job applications
- Benefit: Official, reliable, legal
- Timeline: 2-4 weeks approval

**Option B: Manual Job Entry Workflow** (WORKS NOW)
- Staff browses NHS Jobs manually
- Copies job details
- Uses "Simple Test" → "Add One Test Job"
- System creates applications automatically
- **This works perfectly right now!**

**Option C: Fix Web Scraper** (TECHNICAL)
- Debug NHS Jobs website structure
- Update HTML selectors
- Handle anti-bot measures
- May break when site updates
